# Writing Documentation

This documentation is intended for augmenting or creating a document in the `_docs` folder.

Guidelines:

- It must have a clear title and a specific purpose.
- The file name must be identical to the title.
- Each document must be referenced in `AGENTS.md`, with a short one-liner description if the filename is not self-explanatory.
- When you write a new document, its initial content size is usually between 40 to 80 lines.

Be brief and specific. Do not include obvious information. If there is nothing to explain, then do not explain. Do not include generic best practices: it's not a tutorial. A document is always **a reference for a skilled newcomer**.

Do not include too big code snippets as they are easily outdated. Instead, include small snippets and reference the relevant source files where examples can be found.
