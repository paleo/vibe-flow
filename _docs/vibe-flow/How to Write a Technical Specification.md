# How to Write a Technical Specification

## Pre-requisites

Before you start, read the `Vibe Flow Guide.md` entirely.

You need:

- the TASK_DIR - if you don't have it, ask the user for a **ticket ID**
- the current CYCLE_LETTER and the next FILE_NUMBER - deduce them by yourself - by default, start with a new cycle (bump the CYCLE_LETTER, reset the FILE_NUMBER to 1)

## Phases

When the user asks you for a SPEC (technical specification), you MUST follow this process:

1. **Investigation Phase**: Research the codebase to understand the current implementation and identify the problem
2. **Discussion Phase**: Collaborate with the user to explore the problem space and potential solutions BEFORE writing the specification file
3. **Specification Phase**: Only after user approval, write the final specification file

The discussion phase is MANDATORY. Remember that you are a newcomer to this project while the user has extensive experience with the codebase and will be happy to help guide you.

## Discussion Format

Engage in a thorough collaborative discussion covering:

- **Problem exploration**: Present your understanding of the problem and ask clarifying questions
- **Current implementation analysis**: Share what you discovered and ask for confirmation or corrections
- **Multiple solution approaches**: Present several viable alternatives when they exist, explaining trade-offs
- **Sub-subject identification**: Break down the problem into all relevant sub-components and ensure each is addressed
- **Design decisions**: Ask for user input on key architectural choices
- **Edge cases and implications**: Explore potential issues and broader system impacts

You should ask questions freely to ensure you fully understand:

- The problem context and requirements
- Existing patterns and conventions in the codebase
- User preferences for implementation approaches
- Any constraints or considerations you might have missed

## Specification File Guidelines

After the user approves your proposal, write the specification in a markdown file in TASK_DIR. Compose the filename with the current CYCLE_LETTER and the next FILE_NUMBER, e.g. `A1-spec.md`. Do not overwrite an existing file.

- Usually a specification is around 40~60 lines
- **Do not add backward compatibility** unless explicitly requested. Prefer clean code. Unused code must be removed.
- A specification is not always immediately executed, and you have to assume that the code can change before it is executed. You can mention a function by name, but NEVER mention specific line numbers as they will become obsolete
- Do not include any detailed code in the specification. Instead, refer to the relevant source files by their paths or function names
- Assume that the specification will be read by developers already familiar with the documentation in the codebase
- Do not include sections like "Benefits", "Code Style Compliance" or anything that adds no new information. Focus on the problem and the solution

_Important Note: There will be lint errors in the markdown file you write. Ignore them. NEVER FIX LINT ERRORS (FORMATTING ISSUES) IN THE SPEC._
