# alignfirst-developer-tests

Dockerised regression-test harness for the `myclaw` reference workspace at [`workspace/`](workspace/). Local-only. Manually run.

Standalone consumer of the `@paleo/openclaw-*` packages (own `package-lock.json`, not part of the root npm workspaces). See upstream docs for the generic mechanics:

- [packages/openclaw-test/README.md](../packages/openclaw-test/README.md) — install, configure, run, scenario primitives, artifact layout.
- [docs/alignfirst-developer/openclaw-test-architecture.md](../docs/alignfirst-developer/openclaw-test-architecture.md) — internals.

This README only documents what is specific to this harness.

## Install & run

```sh
cp .env.local.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local — fill ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and select ALIGNFIRST_CODE_AGENT

# Build the real alcode, alignfirst, and alproject CLIs the gateway runs.
npm run build --prefix ..

npm run vendor   # build + pack the local @paleo/openclaw-* into vendor/ (first run only; env:build repeats it)
npm install
npm run env:build
npm run env:up
npm run e2e -- --channel all --all
npm run env:down
```

See the upstream README for all flags. `--parallel K` (or `OPENCLAW_TEST_PARALLEL` in `.env.local`) runs cells concurrently on K worker stacks; per-worker workspace copies land in `.workers/` (gitignored). When upgrading from a pre-parallel version, tear down the legacy un-suffixed Compose project once: `docker compose down` from this dir.

> ⚠️ **Never `rm -rf artifacts` (or `.gateway-logs`).** Each run lands in its own **timestamped** subdir, so runs accumulate without colliding — deleting the directory throws away prior runs you may still need. These are bind-mount outputs; leave them in place.

## Configuration

- `OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE_DIR=./workspace` — the `myclaw` workspace, bind-mounted into the gateway. Workspace edits iterate live.
- `OPENCLAW_CODEX_HOME` — absolute path to a file-backed Codex home. Required for `openai/gpt-5.6-terra`. The gateway mounts it read-only and uses the ChatGPT/Codex subscription; no OpenAI Platform API key is required. Create a dedicated login so test authentication is isolated from the main Codex session:

  ```sh
  mkdir -p .codex-home
  CODEX_HOME="$PWD/.codex-home" codex login --device-auth
  CODEX_HOME="$PWD/.codex-home" codex login status
  ```

  Then set `OPENCLAW_CODEX_HOME` in `.env.local` to `$PWD/.codex-home` with `$PWD` expanded to its absolute value. Repeat the login when the stored access token expires.
- `ALIGNFIRST_DEVELOPER_PLAYBOOK_SKILL_DIR` — host path to the `alignfirst-developer-openclaw-playbook` skill, bind-mounted into the gateway. Playbook edits iterate live, no rebuild.
- `ALIGNFIRST_REPO_DIR` — host path to the monorepo root (build it first). Live-mounted read-only at `/opt/alignfirst`; the `alcode`, `alignfirst`, and `alproject` wrappers run all three CLIs from the checkout. Alcode runs for real, while both `claude` and `codex` resolve to the mock through PATH. Delegation instructions come from `alcode --openclaw-guide` (rendered from `packages/alcode/templates/`, so guide edits iterate live).
- `ALIGNFIRST_CODE_AGENT=codex|claude` — required selector for alcode's child. It does not affect the OpenClaw conversation model. `ALIGNFIRST_CODE_MODELS` optionally narrows the agent models or pins a full Codex slug.
- [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) — one shared fixture volume on gateway + runner at `/home/claw/projects`; the skill and monorepo bind mounts on `gateway`; `OPENCLAW_TEST_JUDGE_MODEL=anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5` on `runner`.

## Fixtures

Each scenario starts fresh: [`scripts/reset-fixture.mjs`](scripts/reset-fixture.mjs) (run via `ctx.execInGateway(...)`) materializes three Git repositories on `main`, copied from the committed [`projects-fixture/template/`](projects-fixture/template/). `nimbus` and `lumen` live under `/home/claw/projects`; `orion` lives under `/home/claw/projects/external-projects`. Each project has `.alignfirst.json`, a project-specific package name, `README.md` and `DEVELOPERS.md` headings, its own 20-port block (6500, 6520, and 6540), and an untracked `.plans/` directory.

The root and its nested `external-projects` and `lifecycle-projects` directories carry `.alignfirst-projects.json` markers with descriptions and port ranges. The lifecycle directory resets empty; the creation scenario uses it for `nova`. Removal scenarios seed a real linked `nimbus` workspace and a sibling additional directory after reset.

`alproject` runs for real against the fixture tree and calls `alignfirst config --json` in each child. Scenarios assert on the agent's exec calls and on the filesystem.

## Scenarios

Drop `scenarios/<id>.ts`, default-export `async (ctx: ScenarioContext) => void`. Shared helpers under `scenarios/_lib/` (skipped by the runner's discovery). Current scenarios: `A01`–`A21` and `A23`–`A26`.

Almost every one starts with `bootstrapThreadFromChannel` (`_lib/thread-bootstrap.ts`): it sends the channel message, waits for the starter, and asserts the channel session stopped right there — one thread post, no second one, no worktree on disk, no coding-agent call, nothing substantive leaked to the channel root. `sendInThread` then wakes the thread session, which owns the actual work. A scenario that seeds a worktree first passes its absolute path as `seededWorktreePaths` so the check still catches anything the channel session created.

`A10` exercises the real `alcode` foreground run driven as an OpenClaw background exec and rejects direct Claude or Codex launches. `A11` covers an explicit user hold. `A12` chains two delegations in one thread, exposing the heartbeat-cooldown wake gate. `A13` drives alcode directly for deterministic selected-agent new/resume coverage and Codex failure handling. The shared mock serves a bundled Codex model catalog and both agents' JSONL protocols.

`A06` pins first-turn lookup caching across two off-project messages. `A14` covers sole-project inference, `A15` duplicate-name path selection, and `A16` carries an external canonical path through workspace setup and delegation.

`A17` creates and prepares `nova`, bootstraps it on `main` without an AlignFirst protocol, and checks the initial commit. `A18` confirms exact paths before removing a linked workspace and its main worktree. `A19` makes workspace removal fail on an uncommitted file and checks that the filesystem and project config remain intact.

`A23` resolves a PR URL through review and its reported outcome. `A24` carries a multi-project base refresh through one no-protocol delegation per project. `A25` captures a detailed request before workspace setup and coding. `A26` reserves the next side ticket `side-N` before workspace setup for explicit no-ticket work.

Rebuild the CLIs and harness image before focused coverage:

```sh
npm run build --prefix ..
npm run env:build

ALIGNFIRST_CODE_AGENT=codex npm run e2e -- --channel discord-mock A13-alcode-agent-contract
ALIGNFIRST_CODE_AGENT=codex npm run e2e -- --channel all A06-off-projects A14-sole-project-inference A15-duplicate-project-name A16-external-project-path
ALIGNFIRST_CODE_AGENT=codex npm run e2e -- --channel all A17-project-creation A18-project-removal A19-project-removal-failure
ALIGNFIRST_CODE_AGENT=codex npm run e2e -- --channel all A23-resource-url-handoff A24-multi-project-handoff A25-detailed-request-handoff A26-explicit-no-ticket
ALIGNFIRST_CODE_AGENT=codex npm run e2e -- --channel all A10-coding-session A12-sequential-coding-sessions
ALIGNFIRST_CODE_AGENT=claude npm run e2e -- --channel all A13-alcode-agent-contract A10-coding-session
npm run e2e -- --model gpt-5.6-terra --channel all --all
```

**Ticket-id convention:** scenario `A<S>` uses `ABC-0<S>N` (`A1` → `ABC-010`, `A2` → `ABC-020`, …; `A10` → `ABC-0100`). The mechanical mapping is a leak signal: while running `A<S>`, any `ABC-0<X>N` with `X ≠ S` is bleed from another scenario. The test sender is `ROBIN01`, listed in [`workspace/USER.md`](workspace/USER.md). A5's `aurora` is deliberately **not** a fixture name (unknown-project path).

## Vendored `@paleo/openclaw-*` packages

This harness always tests the **local** `@paleo/openclaw-*` sources, never npmjs — the four packages iterate in lockstep with the mocks and are frequently ahead of a publish. The dependencies are `file:vendor/<pkg>.tgz`; [`scripts/vendor-packages.mjs`](scripts/vendor-packages.mjs) (`npm run vendor`) builds each package and `npm pack`s it into `vendor/` (gitignored). The Docker build context is this dir, so the tarballs must live here — `../packages/*` is out of reach at build time.

`npm run env:build` chains `vendor` → `npm install` (refreshes `package-lock.json` against the new tarballs) → `openclaw-test env build`, so a source edit in any of the four packages is picked up on the next `env:build` with no manual step. `npm pack` is byte-reproducible, so unchanged sources produce no lockfile churn. Run `npm run vendor` by hand before the first `npm install` (the tarballs must exist for it to resolve).

## Layout

- [`openclaw.json`](openclaw.json) · [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) · [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) · [`package.json`](package.json) · [`scripts/vendor-packages.mjs`](scripts/vendor-packages.mjs) — committed.
- `vendor/` (gitignored) — locally-built `@paleo/openclaw-*` tarballs, regenerated by `npm run vendor`.
- `.env.local` (gitignored) — API keys, workspace/skill/repository paths, and `ALIGNFIRST_CODE_AGENT`.
- `artifacts/` (gitignored) — per-run outputs.
- `.gateway-logs/` (gitignored) — `raw-stream.jsonl` (opt-in). Session transcripts live in the gateway's SQLite store; each cell's artifact dir archives them as `transcripts.json`.
