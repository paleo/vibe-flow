  "A thread-opening handoff message from a chat bot. Judge only the message; the user's original request is not shown. Accept: the project, canonical path, ticket, task and detailed request the user supplied, carried faithfully; a missing ticket, project, path or scope that is omitted or marked 'to be defined' in the user's language, since users often give none; a question asking for one of those missing values; a statement that the work starts now, continues in this thread, or announces what the thread will do next, including destructive lifecycle work the user asked for (removing a project, deleting a workspace); a request to confirm that irreversible work before it runs, which is a genuine question. Fail: the bot asks the user to reply, answer, confirm or send a message so that the bot can start or launch the session, without asking for any specific missing information (for example 'reply here so I can start', 'réponds ici pour que je démarre la session', 'say go'); invented details; omitted constraints the user supplied; the bot claiming, in the past tense, that it has already done repository work (created a branch or workspace, committed, pushed, deleted, read or changed code).";

  "A message asking the user about the new work: requests the ticket id, the change scope/description, or any combination. A plain question about what needs to be done on the project ('Que faut-il faire sur nimbus ?', 'What should we do on nimbus?') is a scope request and passes; do not judge its wording. A 'Task: to be defined' line shows the missing scope and is fine. Fail only when the message asks the user nothing. A brief announcement clause or a leading planning/reasoning note alongside is fine, and so is OpenClaw's structured prompt format (numbered options, 'Reply with the number…' guidance). No off-topic content, no offers to do something unrelated.";

A thread-opening announcement before the question is fine, and so are OpenClaw's structured prompt format (numbered options, 'Reply with the number…' guidance) and a promise about what follows the user's answer (the work session starting, the workspace being set up): future tense is the handoff, not an action claim. Does NOT claim a workspace/worktree/branch is already created or being created right now, and does NOT name a specific project as if it were assumed. May be in the user's language (French expected here).`;

Reporting the worktree's creation timestamp from its metadata is fine — that's data, not an action claim.
