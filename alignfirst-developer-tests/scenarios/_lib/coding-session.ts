// Two agent messages carry the delegation outcome — the "started in the background" ack and the
// "finished" completion report. Both are classified by an LLM judge, never by a lexical regex: the
// message a capable model actually emits varies too widely (a terse "je lance l'ajout de l'infobulle"
// vs. a promise "je te préviens dès que c'est terminé"), and a regex both misses legitimate phrasings
// and mis-catches reasoning narration ("let me launch the coding agent first…") as if it were the ack.
// The judge reads intent. Each thread outbound is judged as it arrives (single-message rubric — the
// framing the judge handles reliably); interleaved narration simply judges false and is skipped rather
// than failing the run. `waitForBackgroundStartedAck` / `waitForCompletionReport` below own this.
