 * - "Je vais poster l'accusé de réception puis lancer le worktree."
 * - "Let me first check the project, then I'll open a thread."
 * - "Now I'll create the worktree." (unless this is a substantive working-thread status)

 * Substantive content (templated starters, status reports, asks for input,

A greeting attached to an internal process note is still narration.

Return \`isNarration: false\` whenever the message carries substantive user-facing content — even if planning or reasoning precedes it. Substantive content includes: a thread starter, recognizable by its leading labelled lines (Task, Project, Project path, Ticket, Request, in any language) and never narration whatever its closing line; a working-thread acknowledgement that the requested work has started; status reports with labelled fields; questions for genuinely missing input; findings; or summary deliveries. A content-free request for the user to reply merely to activate a thread is neither valid substantive handoff content nor an acceptable replacement for explicit startup. Tie-breaker: if the observations answer the user's request or report the working thread's admitted task, they are substantive; if they only justify an internal next step, they are narration.`,
