# Project workspace setup

The setup phase of a working session: get the workspace ready before handling the user's request. You're in a thread session, so your plain-text replies are your delivery — but only the message that **ends your turn** is guaranteed to post; mid-turn lines may never leave the transcript. The message you end the setup turn with must carry everything the user needs: the `[WORKSPACE]` banner (Step 4) and what you did or launched. Never call `message` `send`/`thread-reply` targeting your own thread: it posts everything twice.

## Prerequisites — run both now, before Step 1

- `alcode --openclaw-guide` (`exec`) — the delegation manual. Required every time you run this procedure, status requests included; do not skip it because no coding seems planned.
- read `{PROJECT_PATH}/DEVELOPERS.md` — how to create a worktree or a branch.

## Step 1 — Requirements

You need:

- **PROJECT** — The main-worktree directory name shown to the user.
- **PROJECT_PATH** — The canonical absolute main-worktree path recorded in the thread starter.
- **TICKET_ID** — The external ticket ID or the side ticket `side-N` reserved by the working session.

If PROJECT, PROJECT_PATH, or TICKET_ID is missing, do not proceed. Do not guess or reconstruct these values. Ask the user.

## Step 2 — Post the setup signal

Setting up a workspace takes a while, so tell the user it started before you start it. One short line, in their language, and nothing else — the thread's starter already states the known project, ticket and task, so restating them here just repeats a message they can see.

Vary the wording: "Je prépare le workspace", "Setting up the workspace", "Spinning up the environment", "Getting the worktree ready", "Preparing the branch". No questions, no waiting.

On some surfaces this line never posts (mid-turn text — see the delivery note at the top). Write it anyway, and count on the end-of-turn message, not on it, for anything the user must see.

When the task changed with the message that woke you — a ticket that just arrived in a conversation thread, a scope the user just corrected — add a one-line restatement of what you're now working on. That line is the thread's durable record of the new task, the way the starter was for the original one.

## Step 3 — Name the thread (Discord-only)

Rename the thread whenever its name doesn't match what you now know. Format: `<TICKET_ID> - <PROJECT> - <1-to-5-word description>`, the description covering the task. A ticket that just arrived, a project that was unknown when the thread opened, a task that turned out to be something else — each one calls for the rename.

Discord renames a thread through a post, so make the setup signal carry it: send that line with `message` `action: "send"`, passing the current thread's complete `chat_id` as `target`, the new name as `threadName`, and the line itself as `message`. Don't also write the line as plain text; that posts it twice. The post does not end the turn: Step 4 follows in the same turn, and the turn ends on the banner.

That single call is the whole exception. The post right after it, and every one that follows, is plain text again; with nothing to rename, the tool never targets your own thread.

## Step 4 — Set up the project workspace (worktree, branch, dev server)

The workspace tooling owns worktrees. Run its main-worktree commands from PROJECT_PATH. Create, reuse, and tear worktrees down through its commands only — never `git worktree add`/`remove`/`prune`, never `rm -rf` on a worktree directory, never a branch checked out by hand outside a workspace. A worktree the tooling doesn't know about is invisible to every other session.

A project whose `DEVELOPERS.md` has no workspaces section is not set up for you. Stop there and tell the user the project needs the workspace system installed, offering to run the setup with the `alignfirst-setup-guide` skill.

First, fetch remote refs from PROJECT_PATH with `git fetch --prune`. Then check what already exists for the {TICKET_ID} — two checks, both required:

- **Branch**: from PROJECT_PATH, list the branches, local and remote (`git branch -a`), and look for one matching the {TICKET_ID}. No match means no branch yet — an answer, not a failure.
- **Registered workspaces**: `DEVELOPERS.md` names the project's guide command (`workspace --guide`, with the project's own runner). It gives the commands to **list registered workspaces** and to **set up a workspace** — on an existing branch, or on a new one. Use them.

Never assume the branch is new; `git worktree list` alone does not answer the branch question.

Whenever a branch exists, you work from its workspace — a status request included. "Status" means: set up the workspace, report its state (the banner below), sync the branch (Step 5), then report the work content (Step 6) — never `git log` from the main dir. Pick one sub-path:

1. **Branch + workspace already registered** → use it (no setup needed).
2. **Branch exists (local or remote), no workspace** → set up a workspace on the existing branch (don't create a new branch).
3. **No branch** → for a status request, report that no workspace or code work exists and include any request, spec, and summary files listed by the ticket preflight, then end the turn, creating nothing. Any other request is new-work intent: in PROJECT_PATH, fast-forward the base branch from its freshly fetched remote ref so the new branch starts from the latest base, then set up a workspace on a new branch. Name it `{TICKET_ID}/{1-3-words}`, deriving the short description from the request. A fast-forward that brought in new commits leaves the main worktree stale, and no later step refreshes it: once the workspace is up, run the "Refreshing the workspace after a branch refresh" flow on the main worktree at PROJECT_PATH.

The moment you have the linked workspace path — attached (sub-path 1) or freshly set up (2, 3) — post the `[WORKSPACE]` banner, before any `git` inspection or prose, and **include it again in the message you end the turn with**: the early post may not deliver on every surface, the final message always does (on Discord the Step 3 rename post also delivers). `workspace setup` blocks until the bootstrap reaches `ready` or `failed`; run it in the foreground (no `background` option) and report the state it returns. Run subsequent Git commands and `alcode` from that linked workspace, never PROJECT_PATH.

Bold the values with your surface's markers rather than literal `**`, and translate the labels to the user's language:

```text
[WORKSPACE] **{PROJECT}** — Ticket: `{TICKET_ID}`

Worktree: `{dirname}`
Branch: `{branch}`
Status: {running | ready | failed}
```

The lines below the tag report the workspace: after `Status:`, add what the setup output gives that the user can act on.

## Step 5 — Sync an existing branch on takeover (sub-paths 1 & 2)

Skip on sub-path 3 (no branch — nothing to sync). Otherwise, once the workspace is set up, bring the branch up to date *before* inspecting, working, or reporting a status — a teammate may have pushed since you last synced, and a report off a stale branch is wrong. In order:

1. **Confirm the branch.** Check the worktree's checked-out branch carries the expected TICKET_ID. If it doesn't, stop and surface it to the user — don't work on the wrong branch.
2. **Guard uncommitted work.** Run `git status`. If the worktree is dirty, have alcode commit a WIP first (even if it doesn't compile) — never sync over uncommitted work.
3. **Merge the remote branch.** If the branch has a remote counterpart, merge its freshly fetched ref into the local branch to catch up. Delegate to alcode (`merge` protocol) when it doesn't fast-forward or conflicts.
4. **Catch up with the base branch.** If the freshly fetched base branch (`origin/<base>`) has commits not yet in this branch, run the "Updating a branch with the base branch" flow — without asking; step 7 tells the user what came in.
5. **Refresh the workspace if commits came in.** If the merge brought in new commits, run the "Refreshing the workspace after a branch refresh" flow: reinstall dependencies, rebuild, run the new migrations.
6. **Check for an open MR/PR** on this branch and note its state.
7. **Report what changed.** If either merge brought in new commits, post a one-line summary so the user knows the ground shifted.

## Step 6 — Status request: the work content

Only for a status request; otherwise skip to Step 7. The Step 4 banner comes first — post it before delegating; by now the Step 5 sync has brought the branch current, so the report reflects the latest state.

The `[WORKSPACE]` banner answers "is the env ready", not "where does the work stand". For the work content — what was done, what remains — draw on two complementary sources:

- **Repo/workflow metadata**, which you may gather directly: `git log`/`status`/branch state, `gh` PR/issue state, the `.plans/` listing.
- **The ticket's AlignFirst artifacts** via `alcode new --ticket <id> --catchup`, run from the worktree: the agent loads the ticket history and returns a synthesis.

Combine them into the report and post it in the thread; use `--catchup` whenever the ticket history matters. Add `--protocol aad` or `--protocol spec` to continue with that protocol in the same agent call. What you must **not** do is browse the source to describe how the code works — that's a delegation to alcode, not part of a status report.

## Step 7 — Start the work

The workspace is ready, so get to it: announce what you're about to do in one line, then do it. The user's request is the go-ahead; asking them to confirm it again wastes a turn.

Ask only when you genuinely can't proceed — the request is ambiguous enough that two readings lead to different work, or it turns on a product decision that isn't yours to make.
