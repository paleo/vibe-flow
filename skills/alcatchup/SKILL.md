Run `npx -y alignfirst ticket <ticket-id> --catchup` to load the ticket history. If the ticket ID is unknown, run `npx -y alignfirst ticket --catchup` instead; the CLI deduces it from the branch. When it cannot, ask the user.

Then follow the user's instructions. Without instructions, return a short synthesis: what was requested, decided, done, and left open.
