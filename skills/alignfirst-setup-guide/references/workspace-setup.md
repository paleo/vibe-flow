# Implementing Worktree-Based Concurrent Local Environments

Blueprint for a **workspace** system — multiple git-worktree dev environments side by side. Requires git. The templates are Node.js, but the approach fits any runtime.

**Node consumers** install `@paleo/workspace` and write thin wrappers — `workspace.mjs`, plus `dev-server.mjs` when the project has a dev server — that build a config object and call `runWorkspace(config)` / `runDevServer(config)`. The package owns the kernel (workspace and dev-server registries, port allocation, branch lifecycle, process control, log polling, CLI). You supply project callbacks (`finalizeWorkspace`, `formatSummary`, optional `purgeInfrastructure`) plus a `gitignoredFiles` list.

**Non-Node consumers** reimplement the system from this design; the concept sections are self-contained. A project managed by an AlignFirst Developer must also meet [the AlignFirst Developer contract](#the-alignfirst-developer-contract).

The `assets/` scripts ([workspace.mjs](../assets/workspace.mjs), [dev-server.mjs](../assets/dev-server.mjs)) are annotated references. Each field carries an `ADAPT` comment. Copy a script, fill in the `ADAPT` points, then **strip the scaffolding comments** — keep only the rare comment explaining a non-obvious project choice. Aim for lean wrappers.

**The operating surface is self-documented.** `workspace --guide` (rendered in the project's package manager) lists every command, flag, recovery path, and the directory layout, adapted to the config — a portless project's guide carries no port or dev-server section. Read it; don't restate it, and point agents at it (see [Agent Instructions](#agent-instructions)). Kernel internals (foreground self-exit, cross-worktree stop, orphan healing) are the package's concern — setup needs only the callback contracts below.

This document is the **setup tutorial**: the decisions you make, and how to wire the wrappers.

## Portless mode

A project with no dev server — or one whose servers need no port — installs the same system without the port scheme: no `ports` group in `workspace.mjs`, no `dev-server.mjs`, no `dev` npm script. `ctx.ports` is empty everywhere, nothing is allocated, and no config file is patched with a port.

Everything else stands: the worktree lifecycle (`setup`, `remove`, `--enter`), shared-directory symlinks, gitignored-file seeding, the idempotent detached finalize and its progress ticker, `list` / `status` / `wait`, and orphan healing (`prune`).

Reading this document in portless mode, skip [Contiguous port scheme](#contiguous-port-scheme), [Concurrent dev-server cap](#concurrent-dev-server-cap), [`dev-server.mjs`](#dev-servermjs), and the port-block paragraphs of [The workspace registry](#the-workspace-registry).

## Implementation Process

Apply in order. The per-project decisions live in the [checklist](#checklist); this section is the sequence and its guardrails.

1. **Require a clean working tree.** Run `git status` first. If it isn't clean, stop and ask the developer to commit or stash. Testing commits scaffolding and creates/removes worktrees and branches — safe and reviewable only from a clean baseline.
2. **Investigate.** Read this doc, then inspect the repo to answer every checklist item: current ports and config files, shared vs per-worktree gitignored directories, database provisioning, package manager, and the dev-server's ready / fatal log markers. Note what needs migrating (scattered ports, a config file not yet gitignored, a colliding dev-script name).
3. **Present findings and plan, then get approval.** Port scheme or portless mode, the shared / per-worktree split, config files to patch, database strategy, dev-server command (and any rename), migrations. **Change nothing until the developer agrees.**
4. **Implement.** Work the checklist: install the package, write the wrappers, add the npm scripts, migrate ports / config, update `.gitignore`, write the agent docs.
5. **Commit once, then test.** Make a **single commit** with all the scaffolding — a prerequisite for testing, not a wrap-up: `workspace setup -c <branch>` builds the linked worktree from the committed `HEAD`, so the scripts and `package.json` changes must be committed to exist there. Then exercise the CLI end to end (the command sequence is in `workspace --guide`): bootstrap the main worktree, create a throwaway workspace, start / stop dev servers if the project has any, `list` and `status`, remove the throwaway, then delete the test branch you created — your own artifact, the one case where deleting a branch is expected.
6. **Fix by amending.** When a test surfaces a problem, fix it, fold it into the same commit with `git commit --amend`, and re-test. Keep the whole effort as one commit.
7. **Never push.** Leave the final, amended commit for the developer to review and push.

## Core Concepts — the Decisions

### Shared vs per-worktree gitignored directories

For each gitignored directory, decide: **shared** across worktrees, or **isolated** per worktree?

- **Shared** directories are symlinked to the main worktree — things that should be the same everywhere: personal notes, task plans.
- **Per-worktree** directories are created fresh in each worktree — things that must differ: databases, caches, logs, Docker volumes.

| Directory      | Kind               | Contents                      |
| -------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| `.local/`      | Shared (symlinked) | Personal notes                |
| `.plans/`      | Shared (symlinked) | Task planning files           |
| `.local-wt/`   | Per-worktree       | Databases, caches, logs       |

Setup symlinks the shared directories and creates fresh per-worktree ones. A shared directory missing from the main worktree is created there first, so every symlink resolves. The names are customizable.

Suggest `.local/` by default, even when the repo has no such directory yet: a gitignored shared directory for personal notes and files, declared in `sharedDirs`.

`runtimeDir` (`.local-wt/` above) stays per-worktree, but the kernel symlinks its `workspace-registry/` sub-directory to the main worktree's, so every worktree reads one registry.

The main worktree's `.plans` may itself be a symlink — into a clone of a team plans repository (see [plans-setup.md](plans-setup.md)); the symlink chain resolves on its own.

### Contiguous port scheme

Most projects scatter ports (server 3000, db 5432, frontend 5173). The system needs **all ports configurable and reorganized into a contiguous block** — one block per workspace. E.g. 3000 / 5432 / 5173 → 8100 / 8101 / 8102 in the main worktree, and 8110 / 8111 / 8112 in the next workspace. A one-time migration.

**Choose a base port that starts a range of at least 200 contiguous ports free on all common operating systems.** 8100 is a safe default (8100–8299). Steer a user away from 8000 — it collides with common HTTP alternates on some systems.

Docker services can remap the host port without touching the container's internal port.

### The workspace registry

A workspace is identified by its **name**: the basename of its worktree directory. `workspaces.json`, under the main worktree's `runtimeDir`, maps each name to its worktree path and state. Commands select a workspace by directory — a path or a bare basename — defaulting to the current worktree; the basename still resolves an orphan whose directory is gone.

**Limitation**: names must be unique. Registering a worktree whose basename already belongs to another path fails with an error naming the existing entry and its path. It surfaces only when worktrees live under different parent directories; the kernel dedupes siblings on its own.

With a `ports` group configured, an entry also carries a **block index** (`portIndex`): `0` for the main worktree — implicit, never stored — and 1.. for linked workspaces. The block starts at `firstPort = base + perWorkspace × index`. Setup takes the lowest free index, and a re-registered worktree keeps the one it had; when every index is taken, setup fails and points at `workspace remove`.

`perWorkspace` is both the block size and its spacing, so it caps the ports one workspace can declare. It defaults to `names.length` — the block is exactly the ports you declared — and is required with `compute`. Adding a port later shifts every workspace's block under the default; set `perWorkspace` explicitly to reserve headroom. The scheme spans `maxWorkspaces × perWorkspace` contiguous ports from `base` — e.g. 20 × 10 = 200, the range the base-port choice above must keep free.

Registry (under the main worktree's `runtimeDir`, e.g. `.local-wt/workspace-registry/workspaces.json`):

```json
{
  "workspaces": {
    "myproject-feat-214": {
      "worktree": "/abs/path/myproject-feat-214",
      "createdAt": "2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
      "status": "ready",
      "portIndex": 1
    }
  }
}
```

### Concurrent dev-server cap

Host RAM is shared; parallel dev-servers can exhaust it. Pass `maxConcurrentDevServers` to `runDevServer` (omit for no limit). `5` is a sensible default — bump it for a light stack, lower it for a heavy one. A second registry, `dev-servers.json`, tracks live servers; at the cap, `dev` / `dev up` aborts and lists the active servers (re-run with `--evict` to stop the oldest and proceed).

### Gitignored files: **all** of them

Config files carrying ports (`.env`, `docker-compose.yml`, …) **must be gitignored**: worktrees share one git history, so a tracked config would be identical everywhere, defeating per-worktree ports.

`gitignoredFiles` seeds a gitignored file into each new worktree, then patches it per workspace. It is **not only for port-bearing files** — it is for **every gitignored file a worktree needs to function**. Each entry declares where its initial content comes from via `source.kind`:

- `{ kind: "mainWorktree", fallback? }` — use the file at the same path in the main worktree when it exists. Otherwise, use the optional committed fallback from the current worktree's branch.
- `{ kind: "committed", path }` — copy a committed template (e.g. an `.example`) from the new worktree's own checkout, so it tracks the branch.
- `{ kind: "content", content }` — an inline string, or a sync/async function receiving the patch context and returning a string.

Functional content and `patch(content, ctx)` receive the same context: `{ name, ports, mainWorktree, currentWorktree, isMainWorktree }`. The boolean is `true` while setting up the main worktree. **Omit `patch` to copy the selected content verbatim**:

- **Port-bearing** files patch the workspace's ports in: use `helpers.patchEnvFile` for `KEY=VALUE` files, and `helpers.extractHost` to preserve a non-localhost host (a main-worktree `API_URL=http://1.2.3.4:8001` stays `http://1.2.3.4:<newPort>` rather than collapsing to localhost).
- **Verbatim** files need no `patch`. These are the easy ones to forget, and the usual cause of a half-broken linked worktree: editor settings (`.vscode/settings.json`), a secondary `.env`, a private-registry token (`.npmrc`), a package's own env file, etc. **List every one** — a missing entry means the linked worktree silently lacks that file.
- Set `optional: true` for a file that may legitimately be absent at its source; it then warns and skips instead of aborting.

**Main-worktree fallback flow.** Declare `{ kind: "mainWorktree", fallback: ".env.example" }` when a committed template exists. Resolution first checks the entry path in the main worktree. If that file is absent, it resolves `fallback` from the current worktree's branch. Without a fallback, a missing main file retains the standard required or optional source behavior.

The fallback supports fresh main and linked setup. Its content still passes through `patch` before the target is written. Once the main file exists, linked workspaces inherit that customized content instead. A linked setup may read its branch's fallback without creating the missing main-worktree file as a side effect.

## Writing the Wrappers

The assets annotate every field; read them as you fill in the `ADAPT` points. This section is the contract those annotations assume. A portless project writes `workspace.mjs` alone.

### `workspace.mjs`

Builds a `WorkspaceConfig` and calls `runWorkspace`. Key fields:

- `workspaceScript` — absolute path; leave the `import.meta.url` line as-is (the package re-spawns the script for the detached finalize phase).
- `devServerScript` — absolute path to `dev-server.mjs`, so removal can shell out to it. Omit it when the project has no dev-server script.
- `ports` — optional group: `base` (first port of the main worktree's block), `maxWorkspaces` (main included, required), `perWorkspace` (defaults to `names.length`; required with `compute`), and exactly one of `names` (consecutive ports from `firstPort`) or `compute({ index, firstPort })` (full control; computed ports must stay within the block). Omit the whole group for [portless mode](#portless-mode). See [The workspace registry](#the-workspace-registry).
- `sharedDirs` (symlinked from main), `runtimeDir` (per-worktree; holds logs and the registry).
- `gitignoredFiles: Array<{ path, source, patch?, optional? }>` — one entry per gitignored file (see above). `source` (required) is `{ kind: "mainWorktree", fallback? }`, `{ kind: "committed", path }`, or `{ kind: "content", content }`. Functional `content(ctx)` and `patch(content, ctx)` receive `{ name, ports, mainWorktree, currentWorktree, isMainWorktree }`; omit `patch` to copy verbatim.
- `preSetup({ name, isMainWorktree, currentWorktree, mainWorktree, force, profile?, log })` — optional; runs **before** `gitignoredFiles` are copied. Use it for work outside file-source resolution, such as checking the plans clone with `npx alignfirst plans check`, creating directories, or configuring git hooks. **MUST be idempotent**; on a linked-worktree setup it MUST NOT mutate the main worktree. Omit the hook only when it has no remaining work. `profile` is set only during `setup --profile <name>`: check the profile's external requirements here (an environment variable, a reachable host) to fail before any file is written.
- `setupProfiles: { <name>: { description, apply } }` — optional; enables `setup --profile <name>`. The kernel checks the name and lists each `description` (one line) in `--help` and `--guide`. `apply({ name, ports, currentWorktree, mainWorktree, isMainWorktree, log })` runs on the **main worktree only**, after `gitignoredFiles` are seeded, and rewrites the ignored files for that environment. The profile rewrites the ignored main files once; linked worktrees inherit them through `mainWorktree` sources, so patchers stay profile-agnostic. Check every computed change before the first write, leave unrelated files untouched, and **MUST be idempotent** — reapplying the same profile produces the same files.
- `finalizeWorkspace(ctx)` — the detached background step: infrastructure startup, DB readiness wait, install / build, migrations, seed. `ctx` carries `name`, `ports`, `branch`, `currentWorktree`, `mainWorktree`, `isMainWorktree`, `force`, and `progress(label)`. **MUST be idempotent** — `workspace setup` is the documented retry path and re-runs it; idempotency also covers a name reused after an orphan (force-remove the stale container named after the workspace before `up`). **Run `npm install` first**, so any later failure still leaves usable `node_modules/` for the retry to import `@paleo/workspace`. May `return { purgeData }` — an opaque blob persisted on the registry entry and handed to `purgeInfrastructure`; use it **only** for teardown identifiers you can't re-derive at purge time (deterministic container / volume names come from `name` + paths, so they don't go here).
- `purgeInfrastructure(ctx)` — optional destructive teardown (typically `docker compose down -v`). Runs on `workspace remove`, `prune`, and orphan removal. **MUST be idempotent and cwd-independent**: `ctx.worktree` may be gone (orphan), so branch on its presence and tear down *by name* in that case — derive names from `ctx.name` / `ctx.worktree` / `ctx.mainWorktree`, and read `ctx.purgeData` for non-derivable ids. Swallow errors.
- `formatSummary(ctx)` — returns the post-setup string. Don't list dev-server URLs; the dev-server isn't running yet at this point.

### `dev-server.mjs`

Builds a `DevServerConfig` and calls `runDevServer`. `servers: ServerDescriptor[]` — one entry per server, conceptually one dev server. Discriminated on `kind`:

- `kind: "spawn"` — `{ name, exec, port?, detectReady, detectError? }`. The runner spawns the process, logs to `<runtimeDir>/logs/<name>.log`, polls the log for readiness, and tracks the PID. Read `port` from your config with `helpers.readPortFromEnvFile(file, varName)` / `helpers.readPortFromJsonFile(file, jsonPath)`. Omit `port` for a process that listens on nothing; conflict detection, port sweeping and the summary URL then skip that server. `detectError` (optional) fails fast on a known fatal log pattern.
- `kind: "callback"` — `{ name, start(ctx), stop(ctx) }`. You own the lifecycle; declare infrastructure (Docker, DB) here, typically first. Servers start in array order, stop in reverse.

`kind: "callback"` rules (not type-enforced — read carefully):

- `start(ctx)` resolves only once the resource is ready (no log polling on the runner's side).
- Let a failing command throw (run with `stdio: "inherit"`, or print `err.stderr` on `"pipe"`). Never swallow it — a false success starts later servers against a dead dependency and hides the root cause.
- Thread `ctx.cwd` into every child process and resolve every path against it. Never call bare `execSync("docker compose …")` — it picks up `process.cwd()` and breaks cross-worktree stop.
- Resolve everything inside the callback, not at module load.

Also: `maxConcurrentDevServers` (the cap), optional `formatSummary({ workspace, servers })` — `workspace` being `{ name, worktree, main? }`.

### Database provisioning

Each worktree needs its own database; how is project-specific. The setup must end with a working DB.

- **File-based (SQLite, etc.):** copy the data directory from the main worktree — the simplest case.
- **Docker (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.):** copy `docker-compose.yml` (as a `gitignoredFiles` entry, patching the host port and a workspace-scoped `container_name` so containers don't collide), `docker compose up -d`, wait for readiness, run migrations, run the seed.

**Postgres readiness gotcha:** poll `pg_isready -h 127.0.0.1` (a TCP check), not a plain probe. On a fresh volume, Postgres first runs a throwaway Unix-socket-only server for `initdb` that answers a socket-side `pg_isready` too early; gating on TCP — which that init server doesn't listen on — stops the next step from connecting to it and losing the connection on handoff.

### npm scripts to add

```json
{ "workspace": "node scripts/workspace/workspace.mjs", "dev": "node scripts/workspace/dev-server.mjs" }
```

The single `dev` script carries every subcommand. Don't name it after the app's own dev command — a spawn server running `npm run dev` would recurse; use a distinct name (e.g. `dev:app`). A project without a dev server adds the `workspace` script alone.

## Agent Instructions

The system only works if agents know about it. The CLI self-documents via `workspace --guide`, so wire just two things: a pointer to that command, and the facts the CLI can't know.

### Main instruction file (`AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`)

- **Conventions that affect workspaces** — branch naming and commit message conventions, because the agent creates branches:

  ```markdown
  Branch naming convention: `<type>/<ticket-id>` (e.g., `feat/123`).
  Commit message convention: conventional commits, e.g., `feat: [#123] add new feature`.
  ```

- **A workspaces section** pointing at the guide. Take the definition from the first paragraph of `workspace --guide`, which already matches the project's config — it names ports, a database and a dev server on a port-based project, and the shared directories and seeded config files in [portless mode](#portless-mode). Add the repo-specific facts the CLI can't know, such as a portless project having no `dev` script:

  ```markdown
  ## Workspaces

  A **workspace** is a git worktree (with its branch) plus its own dev setup: dedicated ports, config files, a database, and a dev server you can bring up or down. Workspaces are isolated, so you can run several branches in parallel.

  Run `npm run workspace -- --guide` for the full procedures.
  ```

  Keep it to those two parts. Restating the CLI — `setup`, `remove`, `list` — duplicates `--guide` and goes stale when the commands change.

- **A search-ignore line** so agents skip gitignored runtime dirs. List every shared directory and `runtimeDir`. Extend an existing line rather than duplicate:

  ```markdown
  Always ignore the `.plans`, `.local` and `.local-wt` directories when searching the codebase.
  ```

  Skip this line when the instruction file runs `alignfirst context`; the command renders the
  exclusions.

On a project prepared for an AlignFirst Developer, `DEVELOPERS.md` carries the same workspaces section. The definition and the pointer to `--guide` are sufficient; do not copy the command list.

### Project-specific facts the guide can't know

Record only repo-specific facts, in whatever entry point developers and agents already read (`README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `DEVELOPERS.md`):

1. **URLs to open after `dev` starts** (admin UI, auto-login), with the dynamic port.
2. **Any project quirk** — extra build steps, a non-obvious log path.

The release process is not one of them: a multi-step procedure followed occasionally belongs in `docs/`, read on demand — see [Procedures belong in `docs/`](docmap-bootstrapping.md#procedures-belong-in-docs-not-in-an-entry-point).

The port layout is not one of them either: the block table, what raising `perWorkspace` costs elsewhere in the repo, which config file each port reaches. That reference material belongs in `docs/`, with nothing left behind in the entry points. Point at the document from the `ports` group in `workspace.mjs`. Entry points keep only what a reader needs every session: the ports are printed at startup, read them from the log.

## The AlignFirst Developer Contract

An AlignFirst Developer creates every worktree through the workspace system and has no manual fallback. `@paleo/workspace` gives it the CLI it relies on: `--guide`, `list`, the `setup` states, one-command `remove`. A reimplementation reproduces that surface as `workspace --guide` describes it. On top of the kernel, a managed project provides:

1. The workspaces section in `DEVELOPERS.md` ([Agent Instructions](#agent-instructions)).
2. A setup profile named `remote` *(dev server)*, below.
3. A `dev up` summary printing the public URL *(dev server)*: `formatSummary` in `dev-server.mjs` reads it from the patched config file, so the developer reports an address that works from the user's browser.
4. A README section on remote access, below.
5. A Node version declaration (`.nvmrc`, `.node-version` or `engines.node`) named in `DEVELOPERS.md`, so fnm selects the project runtime. Ask which version to declare when the repository has none.

### The `remote` setup profile

The developer's dev servers are reached from the team's browsers, so the deployment runs `workspace setup --profile remote` on the main worktree of every managed project with a dev server. The profile rewrites, in the ignored main files, every URL a browser or a third party resolves: the API base URL, the front URL, OAuth callbacks, CORS origins, allowed hosts. Server-to-server URLs stay on localhost. Linked worktrees inherit the rewritten files through their `mainWorktree` sources, so each file patcher keeps the host it finds and changes only the port.

How the servers are exposed depends on the deployment. The profile has one variant for each:

- **HTTPS gateway.** The deployment has the dev-server gateway: port `<port>` is served at `https://p<port>.$REMOTE_DEV_DOMAIN` behind a login, and `REMOTE_DEV_DOMAIN` is set in the service account's environment. `preSetup` rejects a missing or malformed variable before any file is written. `apply` sets the public URL to `https://p<port>.<domain>`; an application that distinguishes them also gets the public protocol (`https`), the public port (`443`) and the trusted proxy (loopback). The servers keep listening on `localhost:<port>`; the gateway proxies to them. A patcher recognizes a `p<port>.` host and replaces its port label instead of appending `:<port>`: see `publicUrl` in [workspace.mjs](../assets/workspace.mjs).
- **Public IP.** No gateway: the browser reaches `http://<public-ip>:<port>` directly. `apply` reads the machine's single public IPv4 from the network interfaces (a VPS carries it; skip loopback, link-local and private ranges) and swaps the host of the listed variables, keeping scheme and port. The servers must listen on every interface. A patcher that keeps a non-localhost host (`helpers.extractHost`) needs nothing more.

Pick the variant from the deployment that will run the project: the gateway variant when `REMOTE_DEV_DOMAIN` is set in the developer's environment, the public-IP variant when the deployment opens the dev-port range on its public IP. Ask the user when the deployment is unknown.

In both variants, compute every change before the first write, so a missing variable aborts with the files untouched, and make reapplying the profile a no-op. The commented alternative in [workspace.mjs](../assets/workspace.mjs) shows the public-IP variant.

### README section

`README.md` documents the profile next to the setup commands. Gateway variant:

````markdown
### Remote access

When the dev servers are reached through the HTTPS gateway, set up the project with the `remote` profile instead of the plain `setup`:

```sh
export REMOTE_DEV_DOMAIN=dev.example.org
npm run workspace -- setup --profile remote
```
````

Public-IP variant: the same section without the `export` line, introduced by "When the dev servers are reached from other machines through the machine's public IP".

## Checklist

Items marked *(ports)* drop out without a port scheme, items marked *(dev server)* without a dev server — see [portless mode](#portless-mode).

- [ ] **Make all dev ports configurable and contiguous.** *(ports)* Prerequisite.
- [ ] **Design and claim the port scheme.** *(ports)* `perWorkspace` defaults to `names.length`; set it explicitly to reserve headroom. Base port 8100 unless you have a reason. Set `.alignfirst.json`'s `portRange` to the whole block: `first = base`, `last = base + perWorkspace × maxWorkspaces − 1`. The workspace kernel checks both ranges on every command and refuses a mismatch. Document the resulting layout in `docs/`.
- [ ] **Identify your gitignored files.** Every gitignored file a worktree needs — port-bearing *and* verbatim (editor settings, secondary `.env`, private-registry tokens). Do they have `.example` versions?
- [ ] **Classify gitignored directories.** Shared (symlinked) vs per-worktree. Suggest a shared `.local/` by default.
- [ ] **Decide database provisioning.** File copy (SQLite) or Docker + migrate + seed.
- [ ] **Decide the dev-server ready marker** and **fatal markers** (or leave empty) for fast-fail. *(dev server)*
- [ ] **Pair main-worktree sources with committed fallbacks.** Declare each existing `.example` template as `fallback` so fresh main and linked setup work while siblings still prefer customized main files.
- [ ] **Install `@paleo/workspace`** (Node consumers).
- [ ] **Write `workspace.mjs`** from the asset — adapt the `ADAPT` points, then strip the scaffolding.
- [ ] **Write `dev-server.mjs`** from the asset — same approach. *(dev server)*
- [ ] **Add the `workspace` npm script**, and the `dev` one *(dev server)* (don't reuse the app's dev name).
- [ ] **Set `maxConcurrentDevServers`** (default `5`). *(dev server)*
- [ ] **Update `.gitignore`** for your shared and per-worktree directories.
- [ ] **Wire agents** — a workspaces section pointing at `workspace --guide` (also in `DEVELOPERS.md` for a managed project), the conventions, and the project-specific facts. Add the search-ignore line unless the instruction file runs `alignfirst context`.
- [ ] **Meet [the AlignFirst Developer contract](#the-alignfirst-developer-contract)** on a managed project: the `remote` setup profile in the variant matching the deployment, the public URL in the `dev up` summary *(dev server)*, and the README section.
- [ ] **Verify the whole lifecycle** on a throwaway branch: `workspace setup -c <branch>`, then check the linked worktree's gitignored files carry its own ports, start its dev server *(dev server)*, and finish with `workspace remove`. On a managed project, also run `setup --profile remote` on the main worktree (gateway variant: with `REMOTE_DEV_DOMAIN` set to a placeholder domain), check the rewritten URLs there and in a new linked worktree, then restore the main files. A wrapper that merely loads proves nothing.
