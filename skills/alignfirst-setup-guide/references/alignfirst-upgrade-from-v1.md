# Upgrade from AlignFirst v1

This migration removes the v1 `_docs/` system while preserving project knowledge. Continue with the
v3 upgrade reference after these steps.

> **Note**: Commands shown are Unix-style. Adapt to your OS if needed (e.g., PowerShell on Windows).

## Step 1 — Delete AlignFirst / Vibe Flow / AI Workflow Files

```bash
rm -rf _docs/alignfirst _docs/vibe-flow _docs/ai-workflow
rm -f "_docs/Writing Documentation.md"
```

If `_docs/INDEX.md` exists, read it. If it contains any project-specific information (beyond generic AI Workflow index/boilerplate), preserve that information by adding it to `AGENTS.md` (or `CLAUDE.md`). Then delete the file:

```bash
rm -f _docs/INDEX.md
```

## Step 2 — Delete Command Files

Delete all known AlignFirst command files from **all** agent directories that exist in the project. Check every directory listed below and remove the matching files.

**Files to delete** (both old and new names):

- `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `dtdp.md`, `pr-message.md`, `doc.md`
- `al.md`, `alspec.md`, `alplan.md`, `aldescription.md`, `almerge.md`, `alreview.md`, `alread.md`

**Directories to check:**

| Agent | Directory | Extension |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Claude Code | `.claude/commands/` | `.md` |
| Codex | `.codex/prompts/` | `.md` |
| GitHub Copilot | `.github/prompts/` | `.prompt.md` |
| Cursor | `.cursor/commands/` | `.md` |
| Antigravity | `.agent/workflows/` | `.md` |

_Note: For GitHub Copilot, the files have a `.prompt.md` extension (e.g., `al.prompt.md`)._

## Step 3 — Rename `_plans/` to `.plans/`

- If **only `_plans/`** exists: `mv _plans .plans`
- If **both `_plans/` and `.plans/`** exist: `mv _plans .plans/_plans-archives`
- If **only `.plans/`** exists: nothing to do.

Then, remove `.plans/.gitkeep` if it exists:

```bash
rm -f .plans/.gitkeep
```

Search the entire codebase for any references to `_plans` (in source code, configuration files, documentation, etc.) and replace them with `.plans`.

## Step 4 — Update `.gitignore`

Remove all lines referencing `_plans` (e.g., `_plans/*`, `!_plans/.gitkeep`, `_plans`).

Ensure `.gitignore` contains `.plans`, replacing the old block (`.plans/**`, `!.plans/**/`, `!.plans/**/*.shared.md`) if found. If any `*.shared.md` files are committed, untrack them (`git rm --cached`) and tell the user about them.

## Step 5 — Clean AGENTS.md

If `AGENTS.md` (or `CLAUDE.md`) exists, edit it:

1. Remove all references to `_docs/` files. This includes mentions of:
   - `AlignFirst Guide.md`, `Vibe Flow Guide.md`, or `AI Workflow Guide.md`
   - `How to Write a Technical Specification.md`
   - `How to Write Implementation Plans.md`
   - `How to Write a Description.md`
   - `Discuss-Then-Do Protocol.md` or `Align-and-Do Protocol.md`
   - `Writing Documentation.md`
2. Replace any remaining `_plans` references with `.plans`.
3. Remove sections that become empty after these changes.

## Step 6 — Migrate Remaining Documentation (Conditional)

Check if any `.md` files remain in `_docs/`.

- **If files remain**: Migrate them by following [docmap-migrate-existing-docs.md](docmap-migrate-existing-docs.md) to bring the `_docs/` contents into a new `docs/` directory (do not modify in-place). After a successful migration, delete the old directory:

  ```bash
  rm -rf _docs
  ```

- **If no files remain**: Delete the empty directory:

  ```bash
  rm -rf _docs
  ```

## Finish the Upgrade

Continue with [alignfirst-upgrade-from-v3.md](alignfirst-upgrade-from-v3.md) for the CLI installation,
project config, stub skills, and current commands.

Summarize:

- AlignFirst/Vibe Flow/AI Workflow v1 files removed
- Command files removed (list which agent directories were cleaned)
- `_plans` renamed to `.plans`
- `.gitignore` updated
- `AGENTS.md` cleaned
- Whether documentation was migrated to `docs/` via docmap, or no remaining docs were found
- The scope and agents that received the v4 AlignFirst skills
