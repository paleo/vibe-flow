# Upgrade from AlignFirst v2

Remove the v2 agent-skills installation while preserving project-specific instructions and custom
skills. Continue with the v3 upgrade reference after these steps.

Commands are Unix-style. Adapt them for another shell.

## Locate the Installation

Find every project skill root containing `alignfirst/SKILL.md`. Common roots are `.agents/skills/`,
`.claude/skills/`, `.codex/skills/`, `.github/skills/`, `.cursor/skills/`, `.gemini/skills/`, and
`.agent/skills/`. Ignore dependencies and generated output.

When the current skills CLI owns the installation, use
`npx -y skills remove alignfirst --yes </dev/null` so it removes canonical links and updates lock
state. Otherwise remove only the detected legacy `alignfirst` and
`technical-documentation-authoring` directories. Do not delete unrelated skills.

## Remove Legacy Commands

Remove only known AlignFirst command files from existing project directories:

- `.claude/commands/{al,alspec,alplan,aldescription,almerge,alreview,alread}.md`
- `.codex/prompts/{al,alspec,alplan,aldescription,almerge,alreview,alread}.md`
- `.github/prompts/{al,alspec,alplan,aldescription,almerge,alreview,alread}.prompt.md`
- `.cursor/commands/{al,alspec,alplan,aldescription,almerge,alreview,alread}.md`
- `.agent/workflows/{al,alspec,alplan,aldescription,almerge,alreview,alread}.md`

These paths are legacy cleanup targets, not current installation locations.

## Migrate Plans and Instructions

1. If only `_plans/` exists, rename it to `.plans/`. If both exist, move `_plans/` to
   `.plans/_plans-archives/`. Remove `.plans/.gitkeep`.
2. Replace repository references to `_plans` with `.plans`.
3. Remove `_plans` ignore rules. Replace the old shared-file block (`.plans/**`, `!.plans/**/`, and
   `!.plans/**/*.shared.md`) with `.plans`. Untrack committed `*.shared.md` files and report them.
4. In `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md`, preserve project conventions while removing references to deleted
   v2 skills and legacy paths. Remove sections that become empty.

## Preserve Remaining Custom Skills

List the remaining directories under every detected project skill root. If custom skills remain,
follow [docmap-migrate-skills.md](docmap-migrate-skills.md) only when the user wants to migrate them;
otherwise leave them untouched.

## Finish the Upgrade

Continue with [alignfirst-upgrade-from-v3.md](alignfirst-upgrade-from-v3.md) for the CLI installation,
project config, stub skills, and current commands.

Summarize the removed legacy files, plan migration, preserved custom skills, and the scope and agents
that received the v4 AlignFirst skills.
