# Slack Channel

**Role: Slack administrator** for the platform setup, **operator** for the smoke test. Platform setup runs before `04` (its tokens and IDs go into `infra/openclaw/.env`); the smoke test runs after `08`.

## Socket Mode

OpenClaw talks to Slack in Socket Mode: the gateway opens an outbound WebSocket, so the server needs no public URL, no webhook, and no inbound firewall rule. Two tokens are involved: a **bot token** (`xoxb-…`) that reads and posts messages, and an **app-level token** (`xapp-…`) that only opens the WebSocket.

## Create the App from the Manifest

The manifest below keeps what a member of one **private** channel needs: read history and files, post and edit its own messages, read and add reactions, manage pins, see users, and run the `/openclaw` slash command. It omits the DM, group-DM, and Home-tab surfaces, so Slack cannot deliver a DM to the bot even if the gateway's `dmPolicy` drifts. It omits `channels:manage`, so the bot cannot invite, rename, or archive the channel.

> **User action required.** Go to <https://api.slack.com/apps/new> → **From a manifest** → pick the workspace → paste the JSON → **Create**. Leave **Distribution** off.

```json
{
  "display_information": {
    "name": "{{DEVELOPER_NAME}}",
    "description": "AlignFirst Developer"
  },
  "features": {
    "bot_user": { "display_name": "{{DEVELOPER_NAME}}", "always_online": true },
    "app_home": {
      "home_tab_enabled": false,
      "messages_tab_enabled": false,
      "messages_tab_read_only_enabled": false
    },
    "slash_commands": [
      {
        "command": "/openclaw",
        "description": "Send a command to the developer",
        "should_escape": false
      }
    ]
  },
  "oauth_config": {
    "scopes": {
      "bot": [
        "app_mentions:read",
        "chat:write",
        "commands",
        "files:read",
        "files:write",
        "groups:history",
        "groups:read",
        "pins:read",
        "pins:write",
        "reactions:read",
        "reactions:write",
        "users:read"
      ]
    }
  },
  "settings": {
    "socket_mode_enabled": true,
    "event_subscriptions": {
      "bot_events": [
        "app_mention",
        "message.groups",
        "member_joined_channel",
        "member_left_channel",
        "pin_added",
        "pin_removed",
        "reaction_added",
        "reaction_removed"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The seed enables the slash command on the gateway side (`channels.slack.slashCommand`), so OpenClaw chat commands run as `/openclaw /reset`. The command name must match on both sides.

## Generate the App-Level Token

> **User action required.** **Settings → Basic Information → App-Level Tokens → Generate Token and Scopes**, add the `connections:write` scope, generate. The token starts with `xapp-` and is shown once: save it as `SLACK_APP_TOKEN` in `.env`.

## Install the App to the Workspace

> **User action required.** **Settings → Install App → Install to Workspace**, authorize. Copy the **Bot User OAuth Token** (`xoxb-…`) from **Features → OAuth & Permissions** into `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` in `.env`.

After any scope or event change, Slack marks the app as needing re-installation: **Reinstall to Workspace** refreshes the consent and rotates the bot token.

## Invite the Bot

> **User action required.** In the target channel, run `/invite @{{DEVELOPER_NAME}}`.

The seed allowlists that one channel (`channels.slack.channels`, `groupPolicy allowlist`) and disables inbound DMs (`dmPolicy disabled`). An invite elsewhere leaves the bot silent there.

## What the Manifest Can't Confine

`users:read` is workspace-wide: it reads the whole member directory, and Slack offers no channel-scoped equivalent. `groups:read` covers the private channels the bot is a member of. The single-channel rule therefore rests on two other layers: the bot is invited to one channel (history and posting fail elsewhere with `not_in_channel`), and the gateway processes only the allowlisted channel ID.

## If the Channel Becomes Public

The manifest is scoped to a private channel (`groups:*`, `message.groups`). Converting the channel to public cuts the bot off: Slack starts sending `message.channels`, which the app does not subscribe to, and history reads fail. To recover:

1. **OAuth & Permissions**: add the bot scopes `channels:history` and `channels:read`; drop the `groups:*` pair.
2. **Event Subscriptions**: add `message.channels`, drop `message.groups`.
3. **Reinstall to Workspace**. Save the rotated `xoxb-` token as `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` and re-seed (`../operations/configure-developer.md`).
4. A conversion can change the channel ID. Confirm it, update `SLACK_CHANNEL_ID` when needed, and re-seed.

## Collect the IDs

| Variable | How to get it |
| --- | --- |
| `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` | **OAuth & Permissions → Bot User OAuth Token** (`xoxb-…`). Reinstall the app to rotate it. |
| `SLACK_APP_TOKEN` | **Basic Information → App-Level Tokens** (`xapp-…`). Shown once at creation. |
| `SLACK_OWNER_ID` | Your Slack profile → **⋮ → Copy member ID** (`U…`). Gates admin chat commands and exec approvals. |
| `SLACK_CHANNEL_ID` | The channel → its name → **About → Channel ID** (`C…`), or the `C…` segment of the channel link. |

## Notes

- One process per app token. A second Socket Mode connection on the same token replaces the first; a local or staging bot needs its own Slack app.
- Rotating a token: regenerate it (reinstall for `xoxb-`, delete and recreate for `xapp-`), edit `infra/openclaw/.env`, then follow `../operations/configure-developer.md` (snapshot, re-seed, `openclaw secrets reload`).
- Startup logs one `[slack] channel resolve failed … missing_scope: channels:read` line: the plugin tries a public-channel lookup, fails on the trimmed scopes, and falls back to the configured channel map. Cosmetic; do not add the scope.
- `openclaw doctor` warns that `groupPolicy` is `allowlist` while `allowFrom` is empty. False positive: Slack's allowlist is the channel map, not a sender list. Do not add `allowFrom`.

## Smoke Test

Run it after `08`, as the operator, from the Slack client.

First verify the effective gateway configuration:

```sh
sudo -i -u {{SERVICE_USER}} -- openclaw plugins inspect alignfirst-developer --json --runtime
sudo -i -u {{SERVICE_USER}} -- openclaw config get tools.alsoAllow --json
sudo -i -u {{SERVICE_USER}} -- openclaw config get channels.slack.replyToMode
sudo -i -u {{SERVICE_USER}} -- openclaw config get channels.slack.channels --json
```

The plugin must be loaded, `thread_handoff` allowed, and both the global and allowlisted-channel
`replyToMode` values must be `off`.

1. Send small talk in the allowlisted channel. It receives one channel-root reply and no thread.
2. Request a complete small read-only project task. One starter appears under the request and work begins without a follow-up. The report returns in that same thread, never at the root.
3. Request work while omitting one genuinely required value. The starter asks once; no work begins until an answer arrives in the same thread, then that session continues.
4. Post the same project request in a channel the bot is not allowlisted in, then DM the bot. Neither gets a reply or starts work.

When a negative check fails, stop the gateway (`sudo -i -u {{SERVICE_USER}} -- systemctl --user stop openclaw-gateway`) and correct the allowlist or the DM policy before further use.
