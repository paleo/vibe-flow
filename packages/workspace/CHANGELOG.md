# @paleo/workspace

## 0.33.0

### Minor Changes

- 44e1f9e: The kernel checks `portRange` in `.alignfirst.json` against the port scheme.

## 0.32.0

### Minor Changes

- 01074ee: Added `--profile <name>` to `workspace setup`.

## 0.31.0

### Minor Changes

- 214ee98: Added fallback templates for main-worktree file sources and workspace context for generated content.

## 0.30.3

### Patch Changes

- 2877daa: `workspace setup` now creates nested shared-directory links correctly and excludes them only in the linked worktree.

## 0.30.2

### Patch Changes

- 801309f: Published from CI with an npm provenance attestation, verifiable with `npm audit signatures`.

## 0.30.1

### Patch Changes

- 349915e: Improve `migrate-registry-0.30`.

## 0.30.0

### Minor Changes

- fddf1e2: Breaking: new config shape and names in the wrapper scripts, and ports are now optional. Existing workspaces are preserved. To upgrade, follow the steps below.

Install or upgrade the `alignfirst-setup-guide` skill first — an older copy still teaches the previous config shape:

```sh
npx skills add https://github.com/paleo/alignfirst --skill alignfirst-setup-guide
```

Then give this prompt to your agent:

```md
Upgrade `@paleo/workspace` to its latest version, then use the _alignfirst-setup-guide_ skill to rewrite our workspace wrapper scripts (`workspace.mjs` / `dev-server.mjs`) to the new config shape. Keep the old `basePort` as `ports.base` and the old `portStep` as `ports.perWorkspace`, so every workspace keeps its ports.

Our infrastructure names may be derived from the slot number, which no longer exists. Where that is the case, derive them from the workspace name instead, and tear down the old-named containers and volumes before migrating — after the migration their names can no longer be reconstructed. Each surviving linked worktree also keeps those old names inside its gitignored config, which merging and reinstalling does not regenerate: run `workspace setup --force` in each one.

Then run `workspace migrate-registry-0.30` from the main worktree, and follow the instructions it prints.

Commit, then verify the whole lifecycle on a throwaway branch: `workspace setup -c <branch>`, check that the linked worktree's gitignored files carry its own ports, start its dev server, and finish with `workspace remove`.
```

You can delete the `alignfirst-setup-guide` skill as soon as it's done.

## 0.29.0

### Minor Changes

- 60afd89: `workspace setup` now creates a missing shared directory in the main worktree instead of skipping its symlink, so directories like `.local` exist before the first linked worktree needs them. A broken symlink at a shared directory's place in the main worktree is reported as an error.

## 0.28.0

### Minor Changes

- `workspace setup` gains `--dedupe` (append `-2`, `-3`… when the branch name is taken) and `-d`/`--detached` (return once the worktree exists and finalize in the background). A conflicting branch name now fails with a clear error instead of a raw git fatal, and blocking setup shows a progress ticker fed by a new `progress()` callback on `finalizeWorktree`.

## 0.27.0

### Minor Changes

- The workspace CLI now prints its version with `-v`/`--version`. To free `-v` for this, the `--verbose` flag loses its `-v` short alias — use `--verbose` in full.

## 0.26.0

### Minor Changes

- eb16d88: `workspace setup` now always **blocks** until the detached finalize reaches READY/FAILED (the removed `--wait` opt-in is the new default and only behavior).

## 0.25.5

### Patch Changes

- 1c6c16b: `wait --slot` and `status --slot` now accept the main worktree's reserved slot (its base port). Suggested commands in tips and errors are now prefixed for your package manager, and the `wait` tip after `setup` uses the worktree directory name — or no argument for the current worktree — instead of `--slot`.

## 0.25.4

### Patch Changes

- Improve the README.

## 0.25.3

### Patch Changes

- Streamline the README: define what a "workspace" is, and replace the verbose API dump with a pointer to the skill's reference.

## 0.25.2

### Patch Changes

- `--go` falls back to the `cd` hint (and reports the error) when `$SHELL` can't be started.

## 0.25.1

### Patch Changes

- Quote the `--go` `cd` fallback hint and dedupe the registry read in `resolveTarget`.

## 0.25.0

### Minor Changes

- Remove the unused workspace `owner` feature (`--owner`, `set-owner`, the OWNER column, and `owner` in the contexts/registry). Breaking: drop `owner` from `printSummary`.

## 0.24.0

### Minor Changes

- Select a workspace consistently across `remove`, `status`, `wait`, and `set-owner`: omit for the current worktree, give a directory (path or basename), or `--slot <port>`. Breaking: `remove <branch>` is gone — use the directory or `--slot`.

## 0.23.0

### Minor Changes

- `configFiles`: `source` is now required and discriminated by `kind` (`mainWorktree`, `newWorktree`, `content`); `patch` is now optional.

## 0.22.0

### Minor Changes

- Tear down an orphaned worktree's infrastructure on `prune`/`remove`. `finalizeWorktree` may return `{ extra }`, persisted on the slot and handed back to `purgeInfrastructure` (now also called for orphans, by name).

## 0.21.0

### Minor Changes

- 62afc9a: Add `--go` to `workspace setup`: open an interactive shell in the new worktree (exit to return). Falls back to printing a `cd` hint when `$SHELL` is unset or stdin is not a tty.

## 0.20.0

### Minor Changes

- 398e372: Self-heal orphaned workspaces (worktree deleted out-of-band). New `workspace prune` stops their dev-servers, drops the registry entries, and runs `git worktree prune`. `workspace list` auto-prunes the safe case; `workspace remove` now cleans up an already-deleted worktree too.
- 1273837: Self-documenting CLI: `workspace --guide` prints the full operating guide (every command, the directory layout, the guardrails), rendered in the project's package-manager syntax. Consumers point agents at the command instead of maintaining a separate `docs/workspace.md`.

## 0.19.1

### Patch Changes

- 4396c78: Point README Setup at the `alignfirst-setup-guide` skill.

## 0.19.0

### Minor Changes

- Rename the registry directory: `${runtimeDir}/shared-registry` → `${runtimeDir}/workspace-registry`. `workspace migrate-0.16 <old-registryDir>` now merges into the new location and accepts any old registry path — including a 0.17/0.18 `${runtimeDir}/shared-registry` — and relinks worktrees.

## 0.18.0

### Minor Changes

- 966b65d: `workspace remove` no longer checks the remote (`--no-remote-check` is gone — the local branch is always kept) and now refuses on uncommitted changes unless `--force`. `workspace setup <branch> [-c]` runs from any worktree; with `-c`, the new branch starts at the current worktree's HEAD, or at any commit-ish via the new `--from <ref>` option.

## 0.17.0

### Minor Changes

- b027838: Remove `registryDir`. The registry is now derived as `${runtimeDir}/shared-registry`, auto-symlinked per linked worktree by `workspace setup`. To migrate an existing registry: `workspace migrate-0.16 <old-registryDir>`.

## 0.16.0

### Minor Changes

- 8724de4: Add `source` option to `configFiles` entries to override a config file's initial content.

### Patch Changes

- 5494483: Report a failing callback server's `start()` cleanly instead of as an unhandled stack trace.

## 0.15.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix the foreground log-follow offset to count raw bytes (a log with invalid UTF-8 no longer skews where following resumes), and guard `lastLines` against a non-positive count.

## 0.15.0

### Minor Changes

- `dev` (foreground): stream logs from the first byte so the whole startup is visible live, and attach to an already-running dev-server (replay recent log + follow; CTRL+C detaches) instead of refusing to start.

## 0.14.2

### Patch Changes

- Dedupe the dev-server spawn-and-rollback path and make foreground startup interruptible without double-teardown: a CTRL+C arriving while servers were still starting could roll back twice and exit with a nondeterministic code. The signal handler now owns teardown, and the in-flight failure defers to it.

## 0.14.1

### Patch Changes

- Foreground `dev` now exits on its own when its servers are stopped externally (`dev down`, `down --all`, eviction, or a manual kill) instead of hanging on dead servers and holding the terminal.

## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- b05c1fc: Add `dev status` (report UP/DOWN) and `dev restart` (stop then background-start) subcommands. Rename `workspace info` to `workspace status` (breaking).

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- 31c3668: `dev` subcommands + foreground mode; `workspace list` DEV column

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- Align user-facing vocabulary on "workspace" and tidy generated names.

## 0.11.1

### Patch Changes

- Improved the CLI help.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- 18f400e: Renamed to @paleo/workspace, single-verb setup CLI.

## 0.10.3

### Patch Changes

- Upgraded package metadata

## 0.10.2

### Patch Changes

- First version in changelog
