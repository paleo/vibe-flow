# AlignFirst Delegation Guide (OpenClaw)

{{INTRODUCTION}}

## How it runs

`alcode` runs the coding agent in the **foreground** and blocks until it finishes, streaming the transcript to stdout as it arrives. It never backgrounds or detaches itself.

Coding runs can be long (several hours is fine): **always run `alcode` as a background task**, so you stay free while it works. The backgrounding is **your platform's** job, never alcode's own.

Under OpenClaw, background it through the `exec` tool:

- Before the first `alcode` run of this session, call the `session_status` tool and read the `Session:` line from its result — that is this session's key. Obtain it once, reuse it for every run of this session.
- The exec command chains a completion wake onto the run:

  `alcode <command> <options> ; openclaw system event --text "alcode run finished — read its session file and report to the user" --mode now --session-key <KEY>`

  Chain with `;` (never `&&`) so a failed run wakes you too, and keep the `;` on the same line as the `alcode` command: a line that starts with `;` is a shell syntax error, the wake command never runs, and the run's completion is lost. The wake may reach you as a bare heartbeat with the text dropped, and OpenClaw's own `Exec completed` notice may lag behind it — never wait for either text.
- Pass `background: true` and `timeoutSeconds: 0` (no kill timer). Never rely on the auto-yield or a finite timeout.
- Set the exec `workdir` to the project root as an **absolute** path (`~` is not expanded there), or `cd` into the project inside the command itself.
- The session-file path comes from the run's first stdout line (`Session file: …`), available via `process log <id>`. The stamp in the file name is the run's start time; it cannot be derived from the clock.
- `--meta` is for one case only: a **Discord** thread **you created yourself** this turn via `message` `action: "thread-create"`. There, the completion wake's plain reply would go to the channel, so add `--meta "<THREAD_ID>"` with that thread's `chat_id`; the wake then reports back into the thread via `message` `action: "thread-reply"`. In **every other case — always on Slack, and on Discord when the session is already thread-bound — omit `--meta`.** Slack routes plain replies to the current thread and exposes no `thread-reply` action, so a `--meta` there makes the wake attempt an unsupported action; a thread-bound session already replies in its own thread.

As soon as the run is backgrounded, tell the user — in the user's language — that the coding agent is now working in the background and that you will report back when it finishes (e.g. *"The coding agent is running in the background — I'll let you know as soon as it's done."*). Post it even when the user asked to be notified only at completion: this line is the promise of exactly that, not an interruption — a launch with no ack reads as a session gone silent. Deliver this "started" ack exactly like the completion report below: if you set `--meta` (a Discord thread you created this turn), the ack is a `message` `action: "thread-reply"` carrying that thread's `threadId` — your free-form text would stream to the parent channel. In every other case — always on Slack, and on a thread-bound Discord session — the ack is your plain text, and you **end the turn on it**: only your final message is guaranteed to post, so the ack must be the last thing you write, with no tool call after it. Do **not** also post it via `message` (that double-posts), and do **not** poll.

Every run writes a session file under `.plans/`: `.plans/<ticket>/_alcode/<stamp>.md`, or `.plans/_alcode/<stamp>.md` without a ticket. This file is the durable record of the run. Its frontmatter carries `status` (`running` → `succeeded`/`failed`) and the `sessionId`, and the `---- Result ----` block holds the outcome.

**One protocol run at a time per workspace** — protocol runs share the working tree. Finish (or kill) the current protocol run before launching or resuming another. Plain messages (answers, questions) can be sent at any time.

## After a background run completes

The chained wake fires when the backgrounded `alcode` exits: this session receives a heartbeat, usually as a plain heartbeat poll with no message text (the wake text is often dropped in transit). A run counts as pending while it is running **and until its outcome is reported**.

**First, decide whether this heartbeat needs a report.** A heartbeat is the completion wake only while a run is pending. Once you have already reported a run's outcome, later heartbeats for it — a single run can wake you more than once, since the platform's own exec-exit notice may fire on top of the chained wake — need nothing: end the turn with exactly `HEARTBEAT_OK`. OpenClaw suppresses this acknowledgement. Use it alone whenever a heartbeat has nothing new to report; adding prose makes that prose visible.

Any heartbeat received while an `alcode` run is **still pending** (running, or finished but not yet reported) is the completion wake — do exactly this:

1. **Reconcile the run, then read its session file.** Run `alcode status <session-file>` with the path printed on the run's first line. If it reports `running`, keep the run pending and end with `HEARTBEAT_OK`; never report it as completed or start polling. Otherwise read the session file. Its frontmatter holds `status` (`succeeded` / `failed`) and the session id; the `---- Result ----` block holds the outcome. If you set `meta` at launch, it is there too.
2. **Verify, then report — one message that ends the turn.** Run the verification your operating instructions prescribe. Any `alcode` run launched from this wake turn — a manual test, a review, the next work item — launches exactly like the first one: backgrounded, with the chained completion wake; its report is then the launch ack and the outcome lands on that run's own wake. Then report, in the user's language, where the work was requested:

   `Coding run {succeeded | failed} — the agent reports: {one-line summary of the Result block}. {What you verified.}`

   The report must be the turn's **final message**: text written between tool calls may never post, and ending the turn on `NO_REPLY` after a completed run reports nothing at all. Two delivery cases:
   - The frontmatter `meta` carries a destination (a Discord thread target): post it with `message` `action: "thread-reply"` (never `action: "send"`), then end the turn with exactly `HEARTBEAT_OK`. Free-form text would stream to the channel as a stray duplicate.
   - No `meta` destination (always the case on Slack, and on a thread-bound Discord session): the work was requested on this session's own surface, so **your plain text is the report** — write it as the turn's ending, no `message` tool, no tool call after it. On Slack it auto-threads back to the right thread. Never end such a wake turn silently.
3. **Don't reconstruct what happened.** Verifying the result is what your operating instructions prescribe; re-deriving the run's story is not: no re-running the coding agent, no fetch/merge, no `git` archaeology to double-check its account — the session file is authoritative for that.

Reporting the run is not calling the work done: the report relays the agent's claim plus what you verified. When your verification finds a failing check, the report says so, and the fix is new work — a fresh run with its own completion wake; the wake you were answering is discharged by your report.

If the session file says the run failed, report that plainly and propose the next step; don't silently retry. When a session turns bad, keep everything in place — session files, directories, and records are the durable audit trail; never delete them; just start a new session.

If the frontmatter's `exitReason` is `auth_required`, the coding agent is not authenticated on the host. An administrator must authenticate with {{AUTH_COMMAND}} before another run. Tell the user exactly that and do not retry.
