# @paleo/alcode

## 0.15.0

### Minor Changes

- 348c407: Required Node.js 24.16.0 or newer.

### Patch Changes

- 348c407: Correct the OpenClaw guide's Slack delivery instructions and use the supported heartbeat acknowledgement for silent coding wakes.

## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- dda71dd: Added the `astra` Codex model and limited `alcode usage` to Claude and Codex account limits without enabling Claude telemetry.

## 0.13.1

### Patch Changes

- 6d72df2: Prevented OpenClaw completion wake-ups from being lost by keeping the wake command's semicolon on the `alcode` command line.

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- 44e1f9e: Breaking change: the `catchup` value of `--protocol` is removed; `new --catchup` replaces it and loads the ticket history before the protocol and message. `--message-file <path|->` reads the message from a file or stdin. The prompt reaches the coding agent through stdin. `--no-ticket` reads `TICKET_ID` from the `alignfirst` report.
- 44e1f9e: Breaking change: `reserve-side-ticket` is removed, and the `alignfirst` CLI is a prerequisite, run by `new --no-ticket` and by the delegated prompt.

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- a873b8b: The `catchup` protocol replaces `read`: it loads the ticket's history and returns a synthesis, and a following `resume` continues the ticket with that history in context. `reserve-side-ticket` now also counts the side tickets archived under `.plans/_archives/`.

## 0.11.1

### Patch Changes

- ac9b4c5: Updated the OpenClaw delegation guide to OpenClaw 2026.8's exec tool parameter: `timeoutSeconds: 0` instead of the removed `timeout: 0`.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- 99fe331: The CLI is now command-based: `alcode new`, `alcode resume <sessionId>`, `alcode status <session-file>`, and `alcode usage`. `status` reconciles stale runs before reporting them. `new --protocol` requires `--ticket <id>` or `--no-ticket`, which reserves a `side-N` ticket; `alcode reserve-side-ticket` reserves one and prints its id. Added the `-m` alias for `--message`. Required messages reject blank values.
- 99fe331: Added `alcode usage` to show the selected coding agent's current usage limits.

### Patch Changes

- 99fe331: Explained in the delegation guide how a main plan executes: one subagent per sub-plan, orchestrated by the executing agent.

## 0.10.2

### Patch Changes

- 2877daa: Documented how to switch an AAD discussion to a specification.

## 0.10.1

### Patch Changes

- 801309f: Published from CI with an npm provenance attestation, verifiable with `npm audit signatures`.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 3454532: Added explicit selection between Claude Code and Codex.

## 0.9.2

### Patch Changes

- Tightened the delegation guides: the fix step after a code review always runs in a fresh session, and plan files are never read by the delegator — it reads the sibling spec for context and passes the plan's path to the agent.

## 0.9.1

### Patch Changes

- Clarify the OpenClaw guide's completion-wake step: verification is prescribed by the operating instructions, and a verification that launches a coding-agent run (a manual test) defers the outcome to that run's own wake.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 29bcdc5: The `--model` flag now takes a bare model name from a fixed list: `fable`, `opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku`. Set `ALIGNFIRST_CODE_MODELS` (comma-list) to replace the list, e.g. on a host whose plan lacks some tiers.

### Patch Changes

- Delegation guide: the review fix step now points at wherever the review lives (review file, or PR/MR comments the agent fetches itself).

## 0.8.1

### Patch Changes

- 5e9e354: The AAD workflow now states its commit step explicitly: commit with the summary file's suggested message.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 1470b76: The delegation guide now asks the agent to verify a completed run — project checks plus a hands-on look — and to end the wake turn on one consolidated report, rather than relaying the session file alone; spec → plan → execute runs without stopping for the user to approve the plan.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- ff4d909: Documented the review workflow in the CLI reference: a fresh `review` session, then an optional fix step in a fresh AAD session on the review file.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- Detect when the coding agent's session is lost or expired: alcode now seals the session file with `exitReason: auth_required`, exits `2`, and prints a clear message telling an administrator to re-login on the host.

## 0.5.3

### Patch Changes

- 537c8f5: Recommend allowing commits between sub-plans when executing a main plan (CLI reference template)
- c8f0083: The OpenClaw guide's "started" ack now follows the completion-report delivery rule: plain text on a thread-bound session, `message` `thread-reply` only for a thread created this turn (`--meta`) — fixes doubled replies in Discord threads.

## 0.5.2

### Patch Changes

- The OpenClaw guide now marks the "started" background-run ack as a Discord `message` `thread-reply`, so it lands in the work thread instead of streaming to the parent channel.

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- The OpenClaw guide now omits `--meta` on Slack (the completion report is a plain-text reply, since Slack exposes no `send`/`thread-reply` action) and reserves it for a Discord thread you created yourself, and it no longer emits `HEARTBEAT_OK` (a wake with nothing to report ends with `NO_REPLY`).

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- bc41c8e: Resumed and plan-execution runs now inherit or infer their ticket, so session files land in `.plans/<ticket>/_alcode/`. The OpenClaw guide prescribes a chained `openclaw system event` completion wake and English delegation messages.

  `--guide` is now minimal, free of OpenClaw-specific run and wake machinery.

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- The session guide now tells the agent to start a new session after one turns bad, rather than reusing it.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 53fc35d: Session files moved from `coding-sessions/` to `_alcode/` (`.plans/<ticket>/_alcode/` or `.plans/_alcode/`; the old directories are no longer read). alcode now fails fast on `--resume` with an unknown session id, on resuming a session that is still running, and on launching a protocol run while another run is active in the same worktree.

### Patch Changes

- 85e13a3: The `--openclaw-guide` completion-wake procedure now ends the wake turn with `NO_REPLY` once the report is routed via the `message` tool, preventing stray duplicates on the session's default surface.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- Add a `-v`/`--version` flag that prints the alcode version.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- New `--meta "<text>"` flag: stores an opaque handoff string verbatim in the session file's `meta:` frontmatter, for a later reader of the file; `alcode` never interprets it.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- eb16d88: New `alcode` CLI: run a coding agent through AlignFirst protocols. It runs the coding agent in the foreground, streams a live transcript to both stdout and a per-run session file under `.plans/` (frontmatter status lifecycle + `Session ID`), and blocks until the run finishes. The caller backgrounds long runs; `alcode --guide` prints the delegation manual, and `alcode --openclaw-guide` prints the OpenClaw variant (`exec` with `background: true` + `timeout: 0`, completion-wake procedure). If terminated, alcode kills its coding-agent child so no orphan is left behind, and seals the session file with `status: failed` / `exitReason: terminated`.
