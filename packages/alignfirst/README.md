# alignfirst

The AlignFirst CLI provides collaborative software-development workflows, work files, and documentation discovery. Work files are organized by ticket and kept either git-ignored in the project or synchronized through a team repository.

## Installation

Install it globally:

```sh
npm install -g alignfirst
```

Or run the current version without installing it:

```sh
npx alignfirst
```

## Setup with your agent

Temporarily install the setup-guide skill:

```sh
npx skills add https://github.com/paleo/alignfirst --skill alignfirst-setup-guide
```

Then ask your agent:

```text
Use your alignfirst-setup-guide skill. Set up AlignFirst in this project. Ask before installing anything globally.
```

The guide installs the selected components and configures the repository. Remove the setup-guide skill when setup is complete.

## Commands

- `guide` — Print an AlignFirst protocol.
- `ticket` — Resolve a ticket directory, load its history, or get its next file.
- `sync` — Synchronize shared plans.
- `plans` — Set up, check and archive plans.
- `docmap` — Browse project documentation.
- `conventions` — Print the effective project conventions.
- `context` — Print the conventions, the documentation map when `docs/` exists, and the protocol aliases.
- `config` — Report the effective project configuration.
- `doctor` — Diagnose an AlignFirst setup.

Run `alignfirst --help` for command usage or `alignfirst guide` to choose a protocol. `alignfirst guide <protocol>` prints the selected protocol followed by the ticket directory and work file rules. Add `--protocol-only` when those rules are already in context.

## Agent skills

Ten optional Agent Skill stubs expose the CLI to Claude Code, Codex, GitHub Copilot, and Cursor. Protocol skills reuse guides already in context and load missing guides through `npx -y alignfirst guide`. Catchup skills load ticket history through `npx -y alignfirst ticket --catchup`.

Install them globally:

```sh
npx skills add https://github.com/paleo/alignfirst --global \
  --skill alignfirst --skill al --skill alplan --skill alspec \
  --skill aldescription --skill alreview --skill alcatchup --skill almerge \
  --skill alcatchupaad --skill alcatchupspec
```

Start a new agent session to load the skills.

## Workflows

These examples use the `/` form. Replace it with `$` in Codex.

| Workflow | Command | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Specification | `/alspec <request>` | Discuss and write a technical specification. |
| Planning | `/alplan` | Turn a specification into one or more implementation plans. |
| Align and do | `/al <request>` | Discuss and implement a small change, then write a summary. |
| Description | `/aldescription` | Summarize the work and propose a commit message. |
| Review | `/alreview` | Review the current branch against its base. |
| Merge | `/almerge` | Resolve merge or rebase conflicts. |
| Catch up | `/alcatchup` | Load the current ticket history and continue. |
| Catch up and AAD | `/alcatchupaad <request>` | Load ticket history, then start AAD. |
| Catch up and spec | `/alcatchupspec <request>` | Load ticket history, then start specification. |

To implement a plan, start a fresh agent context and ask it to execute the plan file.

AlignFirst stores specifications, plans, and summaries in `.plans/<ticket-id>/`. It normally derives the ticket ID from the request or branch and asks when none is available. Files use a cycle letter and sequence number, such as `A1-spec.md` and `A2-plan.md`.

## Catchup output

`alignfirst ticket [<id>] --catchup` prints the ticket's Markdown files, plans excluded, each in a `<file>` block carrying its path and modification time. When the history exceeds the output budget, only the entry list is printed so the agent can read the relevant files.

## Updates

```sh
npm update -g alignfirst
npx skills update --global --yes
```

## Upgrade from v1, v2, or v3

Install the setup-guide skill and ask your agent to run its upgrade route:

```sh
npx skills add https://github.com/paleo/alignfirst --skill alignfirst-setup-guide
```

```text
Use your alignfirst-setup-guide skill. Upgrade AlignFirst in this project.
```

_Note: the setup-guide skill can be removed safely after it's done._
