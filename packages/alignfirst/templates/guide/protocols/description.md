# How to Write a Description for Implemented Work

## Pre-requisites

Run `{{TICKET_CMD}}` once to identify TASK_DIR and load the ticket directory context (`{{CMD}} ticket --side` when there is no ticket).

## Steps

1. Run `{{TICKET_CMD}} --next description.md --new-cycle` to start a new cycle.
2. Join the reported ticket directory and next filename, then immediately create the description at that path with just the header. Creating the file reserves the filename.
3. If a previous `*description.md` file exists in the TASK_DIR, find the latest one. Only read `*spec.md` and `*summary.md` files that come *after* it — earlier work is already covered.
   Otherwise, read all `*spec.md` and `*summary.md` files.
4. Write the commit message and description into your file.

## Output Format

```md
# Description - [very short title]

**Suggested commit message:** `<commit message>`

## PR/MR Description

[description body]
```

Start with a suggested commit message {{COMMIT_RULE}}. Refine it from the suggested commit messages found in the specs and summaries you read. Keep it brief—usually 3-5 words for the description part. Shorter is better when it's clear.

## Guidelines for the Description Body

- Write in markdown:
  - If there is one subject, write a single paragraph.
  - Otherwise, write a bulleted list with one subject per item.
- **Describe only WHAT was done, never WHY.** Never include explanations, justifications, or reasoning for the changes. Only state what was implemented or modified.
- **Keep it minimal and functional.** Mention each subject very concisely—just the essentials. Most subjects can be summarized in one sentence of about 5 to 15 words.
- **Always prefer functional/business descriptions.** Avoid technical implementation details unless absolutely necessary.
- **CRITICAL: Merge related subjects whenever possible.** Look for opportunities to combine similar changes into a single, cohesive subject. This keeps the description focused and readable.
- Include technical details only for major structural changes (e.g., renaming a database table, significant linter config changes, major codebase refactors).
- Do not mention specs that were not implemented. If in doubt, explore the codebase to confirm what was actually done.
- **Absorb fix-only summaries**: If a summary is about fixing issues introduced by previous summaries in the same ticket (e.g., bug fixes, corrections, adjustments to earlier work), do not mention it as a separate subject. An external reader only cares about the end state.

_Ignore lint errors (formatting issues) in the description file._

At the end, give the path of the description file to the user.
