# @paleo/docmap

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 44e1f9e: The CLI can be embedded with an injected command prefix.

## 0.9.1

### Patch Changes

- 801309f: Published from CI with an npm provenance attestation, verifiable with `npm audit signatures`.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 23c4353: Improved the search feature: any term matches (best matches first), accent- and plural-insensitive, body text included. Results matching in the body show the matching line with its line number.

## 0.8.2

### Patch Changes

- Document the 20-document listing threshold under its own README heading.

## 0.8.1

### Patch Changes

- Listing an empty docs folder now keeps the title and appends an explicit `No documents here.` note, and pointing docmap at a folder that does not exist reports it instead of printing an empty title. When you pass `--root <path>`, that flag is now folded into every command suggested in the short help and the authoring guide, so each one is copy-pasteable against your custom root.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- docmap now lists readable text files beyond Markdown — plain text, diagrams-as-text (`.dsl`, `.mermaid`, `.drawio`), markup (`.xml`, `.html`), data (`.json`, `.yaml`, `.csv`, `.toml`), and schemas (`.sql`, `.graphql`, `.proto`, `.prisma`, and more).

## 0.7.2

### Patch Changes

- Improve the bare `docmap` command when the CLI is run as a global binary.

## 0.7.1

### Patch Changes

- 592cd51: A bare `docmap` now always prints the command list, even for large doc trees. Previously the command list appeared only on projects with fewer than 20 documents, hiding it from exactly the larger projects where navigating with the CLI matters most.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- Add a `-v`/`--version` flag that prints the docmap version.

## 0.6.4

### Patch Changes

- 22ba811: Rename the example placeholders in the help output and README from `topic-a`/`topic-b` to `dir-a`/`dir-b`.

## 0.6.3

### Patch Changes

- 1c6c16b: Improved the README setup instructions.

## 0.6.2

### Patch Changes

- Render help command lists inside fenced code blocks, and drop the listing "Tip" line.

## 0.6.1

### Patch Changes

- Clarify the help hint: run `--guide` before writing a new document or editing an existing one.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 4396c78: Self-documenting CLI: add `--help`, `--guide`, and `--search`. Bare run lists recursively for small doc sets. No-lockfile fallback now suggests the package-runner form.

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- Fixed escaping directory.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 18f400e: Positional path arguments replace `--dir` / `--read`.
