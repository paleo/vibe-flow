# Vibe Flow (Legacy Repository)

> **Note**: This repository is now a migration utility. Vibe Flow is distributed as an [Agent Skill](https://agentskills.io/).

## For New Users

Copy the `_skills/vibe-flow/` directory to your project, or install from [skillsmp.com](https://skillsmp.com/) when available.

See `_skills/vibe-flow/README.md` for usage instructions.

## For Existing Users

If you have Vibe Flow installed with the `_docs/` structure, run the migration:

1. Give your agent [this migration prompt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paleo/vibe-flow/refs/heads/main/migrations/upgrade-to-agent-skills.md)

This converts your `_docs/` structure to the Agent Skills standard (`_skills/`).

## What is Vibe Flow?

Vibe Flow enables _Spec-Driven Development_ — writing specifications before code, where specs guide AI agents through structured phases: **spec → plan → implement**.

It's the structured alternative to "vibe coding" (prompting an AI and hoping for the best).
