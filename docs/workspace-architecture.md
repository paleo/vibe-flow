# Workspace Package Architecture

For the consumer-facing blueprint — concepts, config fields, the CLI surface, and how to adapt the system to a repository — see the [workspace setup blueprint](../skills/alignfirst-setup-guide/references/workspace-setup.md). This document covers package internals and edge-case behavior that don't belong in that guide.

## Setup modes

`workspace setup` creates the worktree synchronously, then runs `finalizeWorkspace` (install, build, DB) in a **detached child** that streams to `<runtimeDir>/logs/workspace-setup.log`.

The child is spawned as `__finalize` with no target argument and `cwd` set to the new worktree. It re-detects that worktree and takes its basename as the workspace name — the registry key — so parent and child agree on the target with nothing passed between them. Only `--force` is forwarded.

- **Blocking (default).** After spawning the child, `runSetup` calls `waitForWorkspace`, which polls `workspaces.json` until the finalize child marks the workspace `ready` or `failed`. During the wait it shows a ticker: a single status line `Finalizing… <label> (<elapsed>) — tail: <log>`, rewritten in place on a TTY and re-emitted on label change otherwise. `--verbose` replaces the ticker with a live follow of the setup log from its current size (the pre-finalize lines were already printed); on settle, one final drain read prints the log bytes written since the last poll.
- **Detached (`-d`/`--detached`).** `runSetup` returns right after spawning the child, printing `Setup continuing in background.` plus a `wait` hint. The caller joins later with `workspace wait`, which runs the same ticker; its `--verbose` first replays the last 30 log lines, since the joiner saw no history. `--enter` enters the worktree immediately in this mode (it already exists), while finalize keeps running.

### Failure before the finalize spawn

`registerWorkspace` writes the entry as `pending`, and a plain `setup` refuses a `pending` entry (`refuseIfFinalizePending`, bypassed by `--force`). An error in the pre-finalize phase that follows — `preSetup`, seeding, a profile's `apply`, `formatSummary` — is therefore caught in `runSetup`: it appends `FAILED: <message>` and the stack to the setup log, marks a `pending` entry `failed` (`markWorkspaceFailed`), and rethrows. A `failed` entry passes the pending check, so the retry after any setup failure is a plain `setup`. A `ready` entry keeps its status: an already-finalized main worktree whose `preSetup` or profile refuses stays usable and is not re-finalized. `copyAndPatchFile` throws a `WorkspaceError` on a missing required source for the same reason: a `process.exit` there would skip the catch.

### Setup profiles

The consumer declares `setupProfiles`, a name → `{ description, apply }` map. `setup --profile <name>` runs the selected `apply` after seeding and before the summary, on the main worktree only. The kernel never stores the selection: the rewritten ignored files are the source of truth, and linked worktrees inherit them through their `mainWorktree` sources. `--profile` is refused at parse time with a branch positional, and before registration when the config declares no profile, the name is unknown (the error lists the declared names), or the worktree is linked. The flag is not forwarded to the finalize child.

### Progress file

The blocking ticker cannot call into the detached child, so they communicate through a file: `<runtimeDir>/logs/workspace-setup.progress`. `FinalizeContext.progress(label)` overwrites it with the current label (and appends `PROGRESS: <label>` to the log); the ticker re-reads it each poll. It is deleted when the log is truncated at the start of `setup` and when finalize settles (ready or failed), so a stale label never leaks into the next run.

### Branch-name conflicts

Git refs are hierarchical: `refs/heads/test` cannot coexist with anything under `refs/heads/test/`. `createBranch` treats a name as **taken** when the exact ref exists (local or `origin/`) **or** a ref exists under its namespace, and refuses with a `WorkspaceError` that names the conflict. `--dedupe` opts into the suffix loop (`test-2`, `test-3`…), preferring a candidate whose branch name and worktree directory are both free so the two stay aligned. An **ancestor** conflict (requesting `test/abc` while branch `test` exists) can never be suffixed away, so it always fails, even with `--dedupe`. The worktree-directory dedupe (`dedupeWorktreePath`) is always on and independent of `--dedupe`.

## Foreground self-exit

A foreground `dev` ([`runForeground`](../packages/workspace/src/dev-server.ts)) runs the same start pipeline as `dev up`, but the servers are spawned **detached** (each in its own process group) and only their **child PIDs** are registered in `dev-servers.json`. The foreground Node parent itself is never in the registry — so nothing else can find it to signal it.

Logs stream from the **first byte**: tailing starts via an `onSpawned` hook fired right after the spawn loop, *before* the readiness wait, so a slow startup (build, `docker compose up`) is visible live rather than appearing only once ready. Because the log is streamed in full, a startup failure skips the redundant 30-line tail (`handleStartupFailure` with `includeTail: false`) and prints only the error reason and the full-log path.

### Attach mode

If a dev-server is **already running** in this worktree (e.g. started via `dev up`), a plain `dev` does not start a second one — it [`attachForeground`](../packages/workspace/src/dev-server.ts)s: replays the last `LOG_TAIL_LINES` of the log, follows it live, and exits when the server stops (same `watchForExternalStop` poll as a fresh foreground). The attached session **does not own** the server, so CTRL+C only **detaches** (prints a notice and exits 0, leaving the server running) — unlike a fresh foreground, where CTRL+C runs the full local stop. `dev --restart` skips attach and replaces the running server.

Three things can end a foreground session, all routed through a shared `shuttingDown` guard so only the first wins:

1. **CTRL+C before startup finishes** — the SIGINT/SIGTERM handler runs `rollbackStart` (kill whatever spawned so far, reverse-stop started callbacks) and exits 130.
2. **CTRL+C after startup** — the handler runs the full local stop (`stopLocal`: kill spawn PIDs + callback `stop()` in reverse + unregister + sweep ports), prints `Stopped.`, exits 0. This is the path that *owns* its servers.
3. **Servers stopped from elsewhere** — `watchForExternalStop` polls the foreground's own spawn PIDs every `LIVENESS_POLL_MS` (1000ms). When none remain alive, the servers were killed by `dev down` / `down --all` / eviction in another terminal, or by a manual `kill`. The watcher prints `Dev-server stopped externally (e.g. \`dev down\`). Exiting.` and exits 0.

### Why the external path runs no callback `stop()`

On the external path the foreground deliberately does **not** run callback cleanup, for two reasons:

- Whoever stopped the servers already owns it. `dev down` / `down --all` / eviction kill the spawn PIDs **and** run the callbacks **and** unregister. Their kill→callbacks→unregister window is multi-second (a `docker compose down` is slow), so a second `docker compose down` fired by the foreground would race the first one mid-teardown.
- A manual `kill` of a spawn PID leaks callbacks (e.g. an orphaned Docker stack) — but that is the same behavior everywhere in the system, because liveness pruning is PID-based (see [Registry liveness](#registry-liveness)). The foreground matching it is consistent, not a new gap.

So on external stop the foreground's only job is to stop hanging on dead servers and exit cleanly.

## Stop and teardown signal mechanics

`stopProcessGroup(pid, 10_000)` ([`process-control.ts`](../packages/workspace/src/process-control.ts)) sends `SIGTERM` to the **process group** (`process.kill(-pid, …)`, falling back to the bare pid), polls liveness every 300ms, and escalates to `SIGKILL` if the group is still alive at the 10s deadline. Because spawn servers are detached group leaders, signaling the group reaches the whole child tree (e.g. a dev server and the watchers it forks).

- `dev down` (`stopLocal`) — for the current worktree's entry: `stopProcessGroup` each live spawn PID, run callback `stop()` in reverse array order, unregister, sweep stale ports.
- `dev down --all` (`stopAllRegistered`) — the same per entry across **every** worktree, then clears the whole registry.
- Eviction — stops the oldest live entries (by `startedAt`) to free room under `maxConcurrentDevServers`, using the same primitives.

## Cross-worktree callback dispatch

`dev down --all` and eviction must stop callback servers (Docker, DBs) in worktrees other than the current one. The kernel can't load each victim's config, so it **reuses the current process's loaded callbacks**, invoking each with `ctx.cwd = <victim worktree>`. This works because every worktree of a repo runs the same dev-server script with the same callback set.

Consequences for callback authors:

- A callback's `stop(ctx)` may run with `ctx.cwd` pointing at a *different* worktree than the one the process started in. Thread `ctx.cwd` into every child-process call and resolve every path against it; capture nothing at module load.
- If a victim worktree is on a branch that declares an **extra** callback server not present in the current config, that server is skipped — running `dev down` from inside that worktree finishes the cleanup.

## The `workspace remove` re-exec

`workspace remove` shells out to `node <devServerScript> down` with `cwd: <target worktree>` rather than stopping the dev-server in-process. This is structural: the `workspace` script doesn't import the dev-server config, so it cannot dispatch callbacks itself. Delegating to the target's own `dev-server.mjs` is how the kernel reaches the callbacks defined on the target's branch. A config declaring no `devServerScript` skips the shell-out. Only after that does `remove` run `purgeInfrastructure` (e.g. `docker compose down -v`), drop the registry entry, and `git worktree remove --force`. Before any of these teardown steps, `remove` refuses when the worktree has uncommitted changes, unless `--force` is passed.

## Concurrency-cap TOCTOU race

The cap check and the subsequent register in `enforceCap` are not atomic. Two concurrent `dev up --evict` from different worktrees can both pass the check and both register, leaving `maxConcurrentDevServers + 1` live servers. This is accepted: the window is narrow and the consequence is bounded to one extra server. Resolve manually with `dev list` + `dev down`.

## Registry liveness

An entry in `dev-servers.json` is **live** when at least one of its spawn PIDs is alive; dead entries are pruned on every read. Liveness is purely PID-based on spawn servers — it knows nothing about callback-managed infrastructure. So if a user kills the spawn processes manually instead of running `dev down`, the entry is pruned but the callback `stop()` never fires and infrastructure (e.g. a Docker stack) is orphaned. Always stop via `dev down`.

## Port blocks and stale entries

The `ports` config group is resolved once per invocation, and a workspace's ports are derived from its stored block index (`base + perWorkspace × index`) — never persisted. Editing `names`, `perWorkspace` or `base` therefore re-derives every workspace's ports on the next command; re-running `workspace setup` in each worktree is what rewrites the config files to match.

Indexes are allocated only when `ports` is configured. A workspace registered while the config was portless carries no `portIndex`, so declaring `ports` later leaves it **stale**: any command needing its ports fails with a message pointing at `workspace setup --force` in that worktree, and `list` shows `?` in its `PORTS` column. The main worktree is never stale — its index is 0 by definition, and never stored.

## Port claim check

Every workspace command compares `portRange` in the current worktree's `.alignfirst.json` with the whole block reserved by the `ports` scheme. A missing project config skips the check. The `alignfirst` CLI owns the file's schema; the workspace kernel reads only the two range integers.

## Registry migration

`workspace migrate-registry-0.30` converts a pre-`workspaces.json` registry (`slots.json`, keyed by port) in place, from the main worktree only. Every other command fails fast while `slots.json` exists, so an old registry never reads as "no workspaces". Worktrees, their gitignored content and running dev-servers are untouched.

Conversion rules:

- All entries describing the main worktree collapse into one, keyed by the real main worktree. Old registries accumulate stale main entries when `basePort` changes, and their recorded paths go stale when the repository moves on disk; the collapse absorbs both.
- Linked entries are keyed by `basename(worktree)`; same-path duplicates keep the newest entry. An entry whose directory is missing migrates as-is — it is an orphan, and the healing machinery reaches it by name.
- With `ports` configured, the block index is derived from the old slot (`(slot − base) / perWorkspace`). A slot that does not fit the scheme migrates without an index — the stale-entry state, fixed by `workspace setup --force` in that worktree.
- `dev-servers.json` entries are rekeyed from `slot` to the workspace name; running PIDs stay valid.

The command cannot rename slot-derived infrastructure (containers, volumes). When the config declares `purgeInfrastructure` — the marker of a consumer that tears down by name — it warns that old-named resources must be removed manually, and that each surviving worktree needs `workspace setup --force`: its gitignored config still names them, and merging the base branch regenerates nothing.

A `slots.json` present next to an existing `workspaces.json` was re-created after the migration, by a workspace command run on a branch that still uses the old package. `migrate-registry-0.30` then refuses and asks for a manual delete, instead of guessing which registry is authoritative.

## Self-healing orphaned workspaces

A workspace becomes **orphaned** when its worktree directory is deleted out-of-band — a manual `rm -rf`, a bare `git worktree remove`, never going through `workspace remove`. Three pieces of state then go stale: the `workspaces.json` entry (points at a missing path), a possible `dev-servers.json` entry (its detached spawn PIDs can outlive the deleted `cwd`, and PID-based liveness keeps it "live"), and git's own `.git/worktrees/<name>` admin files.

Orphans are found by name (`findOrphanNames`): the registry key outlives the directory it points at, so `prune`, `remove <name>` and the `list` auto-prune all reach an orphan by its basename.

Healing splits by destructiveness:

- **Automatic (safe bookkeeping).** `workspace list` drops the `workspaces.json` (and matching `dev-servers.json`) entry for any orphan with **no live dev-server PIDs** — same harmless pruning as the existing dead-PID sweep. It runs **no** teardown (no `stopProcessGroup`, no `purgeInfrastructure`): `list` stays free of process- and infrastructure-side effects. Orphans whose dev-server is still running are left in place and surfaced with a `workspace prune` hint.
- **Explicit (active heal).** `workspace prune` stops every orphan's live spawn PIDs (`stopProcessGroup`), runs `purgeInfrastructure` for each (see below), drops both registry entries, then runs `git worktree prune` to clear git's stale admin files.

`workspace remove` against an already-deleted worktree dir takes the same direct-kill path (shared `stopOrphanedDevServer` helper): it can't shell out to `node <devServerScript> down` (the worktree and its `dev-server.mjs` are gone), so it kills the recorded spawn PIDs, runs `purgeInfrastructure`, drops both registry entries, and runs `git worktree prune` — same full cleanup as `workspace prune`.

**Tearing down an orphan's infrastructure (`purgeData`).** The kernel still can't run a deleted worktree's callback `stop()` — its dev-server config is gone. Instead, `finalizeWorkspace` may return `{ purgeData }`, an opaque blob persisted on the registry entry (in `workspaces.json`, which lives in the main worktree and so **outlives** the deleted worktree). On the orphan `prune`/`remove` paths the kernel hands `PurgeContext` (`worktree`, `mainWorktree`, `name`, `purgeData`) to `config.purgeInfrastructure` (the workspace config — not the dev-server config — is loaded, so the callback is in scope), with `ctx.worktree` pointing at the now-missing dir. A cwd-independent `purgeInfrastructure` tears down by name: deterministic names (containers, volumes) are *derived* from `ctx.name` + the paths, so they need no `purgeData`; `purgeData` carries only what can't be re-derived (an external resource id, a random container id). The kernel stays infra-agnostic: it never reads `purgeData`, only couriers it. Two residual gaps: a consumer that defines no `purgeData`/`purgeInfrastructure` still leaks (prune prints the generic caveat then), and the side-effect-free `list` auto-prune purges nothing — consumers cover that by making `finalizeWorkspace` idempotent against leftover infra (force-remove the container named after the workspace before `docker compose up`).

## Rendering `--guide`

`workspace --guide` prints `templates/guide.md`, expanded by [`guide.ts`](../packages/workspace/src/guide.ts). The prose lives in the template; the command blocks stay in code, so their `#` comments align whatever the package-manager prefix costs (`npm run workspace -- ` against `pnpm workspace `).

Three config-driven flags gate the template: `DEV` (a `devServerScript` is declared), `PORTS` (a `ports` group is declared) and `PROFILES` (a non-empty `setupProfiles` map is declared). `{{#NAME}}…{{/NAME}}` keeps a block when the flag is on, `{{^NAME}}…{{/NAME}}` when it is off. Inside the `PROFILES` block, `{{LIST:profiles}}` expands to one `` `name` — description`` line per declared profile. Markers own their line and one regex handles both forms, so a stripped block leaves no stray blank line. A setup-only project therefore reads a guide with no dev-server section and a workspace definition that mentions only symlinks and config files.
