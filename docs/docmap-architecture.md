# Architecture

Docmap is a CLI tool that turns a `docs/` directory of YAML-frontmatted Markdown files into a browsable documentation system. Inspired by [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/)'s `scripts/docs-list.js` — specifically its hand-rolled frontmatter parser and the `read_when`/`summary`/`title` pattern — with no external runtime dependencies.

## Source Structure

The TypeScript modules in `packages/docmap/src/`, compiled to `packages/docmap/dist/` via `tsc`:

| Module | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `src/parser.ts` | YAML frontmatter extraction (`extractMetadata`) and stripping (`stripFrontmatter`). |
| `src/formatter.ts` | Directory reading, listing/formatting, name validation, `--check`, and file resolution (`readDocFile`, direct path then fuzzy basename search; returns `undefined` when nothing resolves). |
| `src/search.ts` | Ranked `--search`: text folding, tiered scoring, ordering, result cap. |
| `src/locales/` | Per-language stopwords, prefix-stem rules, and irregular-plural pairs behind the `SearchLocale` contract (`en`, `fr`); an ordered registry in `index.ts`. |
| `src/cli.ts` | Argument parsing, flow orchestration, package-manager detection, and help/guide rendering (the `--guide` body is read from `templates/guide.md`). |

Entry point: `packages/docmap/bin/docmap.mjs` → imports `packages/docmap/dist/cli.js` → calls `main()` → returns an exit code.

## Listable Files

Listings, `--recursive`, `--search`, `--check`, and the bare-invocation threshold all walk the tree through one gate: `isListable(name)` in `src/formatter.ts`. It matches the file's lowercased extension against `LISTABLE_EXTENSIONS` — a curated allowlist of readable text formats (Markdown and prose, diagrams-as-text, markup, data/config, schemas/IDLs) grouped by comment blocks in the source. `CHANGELOG*` files are excluded regardless of extension. Binary or hard-to-read formats (PDF, images, office documents) are simply absent from the set, so the choice is a cheap, predictable name check with no byte-sniffing.

Two name rules layer on top of the extension match, both keyed on the file's basename:

- **Secret env files are denied** — a bare `.env`, `.env.local`, or `.env.<stage>.local` (`isSecretEnvFile`). This denial wins over every allow rule and is also enforced in `readDocFile`, so an explicit `docmap .env` refuses rather than dumping secrets into an agent's context.
- **Env templates and template suffixes are allowed** — `.env.example` and its `.sample`/`.template`/`.dist` variants (`isEnvTemplate`), and more generally any file whose name ends in a `TEMPLATE_SUFFIXES` entry. `extensionOf` strips that trailing suffix before the allowlist lookup, so `config.yaml.example` lists on `.yaml`.

A second, narrower predicate `isMarkdown(name)` (extensions `.md`/`.mdx`/`.markdown`) decides which files get Markdown-specific treatment: frontmatter parsing and the fallback `# heading` title in `buildFileEntry`, frontmatter/title validation in `checkAll`, and frontmatter stripping on read in `readDocFile`. A non-Markdown listable file lists as a bare path with no title, is served verbatim, and is exempt from frontmatter/title checks (its name is still validated).

Positional classification (step 5 below) is independent of this allowlist: an explicit path is `statSync`-tested, and any existing file is read regardless of extension — except a secret env file, which `readDocFile` refuses. The allowlist governs what a walk **discovers**, not what an explicit read **accepts**; only the secret-env denial constrains explicit reads.

The `--guide` text lives as Markdown in `packages/docmap/templates/guide.md` with three placeholders: `{{PM}}` for a bare invocation, `{{PM_ARGS}}` for one that forwards arguments, and `{{COMMANDS}}` for the rendered "Browsing with the CLI" command block. `{{PM}}` and `{{PM_ARGS}}` differ only for npm, whose `run` script needs a `--` separator before args (`npm run docmap` vs `npm run docmap --`); every other manager forwards args verbatim, so both resolve to the same command. `renderGuide()` reads the file via `new URL("../templates/guide.md", import.meta.url)` — the path resolves from both `src/cli.ts` (dev/test) and `dist/cli.js` (published), each one level under the package root — and substitutes all three tokens. `templates/` is listed in `package.json` `files` so it ships with the package.

Help and guide command lists are built from shared `CommandRow[]` builders (`browseCommands`, `moreCommands`, `guideCommands`) and rendered through one `renderCommands()` helper that pads each command to the group's longest, so the `#` comments stay vertically aligned for any package-manager prefix. Short help, full help (`Commands:` + `More:`), and the guide's `{{COMMANDS}}` block all flow through it; each group aligns independently.

An explicit `--root <value>` is threaded through **every** suggested command, not documented as a standalone row: `commandsWithRoot()` folds `--root <value>` into the `PackageManagerCommands` prefix once, so short help, full help, the guide's `{{COMMANDS}}`, and the `{{PM_ARGS}}` substitutions in the guide body all render commands that target the same custom root (`docmap --root config/docs --recursive`, `npm run docmap -- --root config/docs …`). Because the fold adds an argument, both `base` and `withArgs` derive from `withArgs` — the form that carries npm's `--` separator. The `--root <path>` documentation row lives in `moreCommands` (full help only) and is shown **only when no root is active** (`showRootOption = root === undefined`); once a real root is folded in, every command already demonstrates it, so the generic row is dropped to avoid a doubled `--root`. A bare invocation still prints its short help unchanged when `--root` is passed, since `--root` is a flag, not a positional.

`detectPackageManager()` chooses that prefix from the **actual invocation**, so every suggested command is one that works in the situation the user is in. It reads `npm_config_user_agent`, which every package-manager-mediated launch sets and a bare global binary leaves empty. An **empty** agent means the user ran the global `docmap` directly, so it suggests bare `docmap` — even inside a project with a lockfile, since a lockfile does not imply a `docmap` script and `npm run docmap` would then be a dead command. A **set** agent walks up from `cwd` for a lockfile: found → the project-script form (`npm run docmap`, `pnpm docmap`, …); none found → the manager's package-runner form (`npx @paleo/docmap`, `pnpm dlx …`, defaulting to npx). A global install invoked through `npx @paleo/docmap` sets the agent, so it keeps the npx suggestion rather than the bare one.

## CLI Flow

`main()` in `src/cli.ts` drives everything:

1. **Parse args** — `parseArgs()` extracts the mode flags `--help`, `--guide`, `--search <terms>`, `--recursive`, `--root <path>`, `--check`, collects positional **paths**, and collects unknown `--flags`. `--search` consumes the next token as its value (same shape as `--root`); without a following token it is recorded as unknown. Tokens starting with `--` are never paths; an unknown one is recorded and later warned about on stderr, so a stale or mistyped flag is skipped rather than fatal. `parseArgs` is pure (no writes).
2. **Resolve base directory** — `--root` or default `docs/` relative to `cwd`. The **display prefix** is `relative(cwd, baseDir)` — `docs` by default, or the root's path for a custom `--root` (e.g. `config/docs`, or `../shared` outside cwd). All displayed paths carry this prefix, so they stay real and openable; the empty prefix (root === cwd) yields bare paths.
3. **Mode dispatch** — modes are tried in precedence and each returns early after printing only its own output: `--help` (full help) → `--guide` (authoring guide) → `--search` (path + frontmatter match) → `--check` (validation) → listing/read. `--help`/`--guide`/`--search` always return `0`; only `--check` can return `1`. Help and guide text is rendered from the auto-detected package manager so every shown command is copy-pasteable.
4. **`--search`** → `searchDocs()` in `src/search.ts` walks the tree (`collectAllFiles`), reads each file once, and scores it against the query. Query terms are tokenized (split on non-alphanumeric characters), accent-folded (lowercase, NFD combining marks stripped, `œ`/`æ` expanded), and dropped when any locale flags them as stopwords (an all-stopwords query keeps its terms). Each kept term then becomes a **variant set**: the word plus, when a locale's irregular-pair table has it (index/indices, œil/yeux), its other number — each prefix-stemmed by the first `src/locales/` entry whose rule changes it (`dependency` and `dependencies` → `dependenc`, `chevaux` → `cheva`). Document tokens are only accent-folded, never stemmed: every stem is a prefix of the query word, so a document containing the exact query form always matches, and cross-form matching comes from the shared prefix. Matching is OR: a file matches when any term occurs. Each file exposes three folded haystack tiers — relative path + title (weight 3), summary + read_when (weight 2), body (weight 1) — and a term scores `weight × occurrences` per tier (occurrences = tokens containing any variant, capped at 3), plus 1 when some token equals a variant exactly. Results order by distinct terms matched, then total score, then path. The top 20 render as file bullets, followed by `… and N more matches` when truncated, or a single `No documents match: <terms>` line when nothing matches. A result whose body matched also carries a grep-style snippet sub-line — `> <line>: <text>`, the body line with the most distinct query terms (earliest on tie), clipped to a 150-character window around the first matched term. Line numbers count raw file lines (frontmatter included), so they are correct when opening the file; metadata-only matches get no snippet, since the bullet already shows the matching fields. Snippets are computed only for the 20 displayed results.
5. **Classify positionals** — each path is normalized (trailing slashes stripped, leading display prefix removed; the bare prefix → root), resolved under the base dir, then `statSync`-tested. Existing directory → listing bucket; everything else (existing file, or missing) → read bucket. `statSync` throwing on a missing path is caught and treated as "not a directory". The filesystem is the source of truth — no extension heuristic here; an explicit file path is read whatever its extension (the listable-extension allowlist gates discovery walks, not explicit reads), the sole exception being a secret env file that `readDocFile` refuses.
6. **Listings** — produced for each directory-classified path via `listDirectory()`/`formatDirectory()` or `formatRecursive()`. With no positionals at all, or with `--recursive` and no directory positionals, the root is listed. A **bare** invocation (no positionals, none of `--recursive`/`--check`/`--help`/`--guide`/`--search`) is prefixed with short help and lists recursively below 20 listable files (`countFilesUpTo`, capped at the threshold), keeping the top-level listing at ≥20. An explicit `--recursive` is unaffected. Files-only with `--recursive` off produces no listing. `renderListingTarget()` guards the degenerate cases so a listing never collapses to a bare title: a target directory that does not exist (only the root can — positionals are pre-classified by `isDirectory`) is replaced by a `No documentation folder at <root>/` line, and a target that renders no files and no sub-directories keeps its title with a `_No documents here._` note appended. Both keep exit code 0.
7. **Reads** — each read-bucket path goes through `readDocFile()` (direct path, then fuzzy basename search). A resolved result is wrapped in `<document_file>` tags; an unresolved one becomes a single generic `⚠ Not found: <path>` line (same wording for a mistyped file or directory — classification can't read intent, and a not-found read keeps exit code 0). Reads follow listings, separated by a blank line.

## Frontmatter Contract

A YAML frontmatter block (`---` delimiters) is optional. The parser in `src/parser.ts` is hand-rolled (no YAML library):

- Finds the closing `\n---` after the opening `---`.
- Extracts `title` (string), `summary` (string), `read_when` (list of `- item` entries).
- Strips surrounding quotes from values.
- Returns an `error` string for unterminated frontmatter (opened but never closed). Missing frontmatter is not an error.

`title` is optional. When absent (no frontmatter, or frontmatter without `title`), `extractFallbackTitle` scans the document body for the first `# heading` (skipping fenced code blocks). `summary` and `read_when` are recommended but not enforced by `--check`.

## Formatting and Output

Listing output is Markdown:

- **Flat listing** (`formatDirectory`) — `# Title`, optional `## Sub-directories` tree, then file bullets.
- **Recursive listing** (`formatRecursive`) — Heading level increases with depth (`#`, `##`, `###`…).
- **File bullets** — `` - `docs/path/file.md` — Title `` with optional `**Summary:**` and `**Read when:**` lines below.

Warnings (⚠) appear inline for name issues or frontmatter errors.

## Validation

`--check` mode (`checkAll` in `src/formatter.ts`) recursively walks the docs tree and reports:

- **Name issues** — Files or directories with spaces or special characters (must match `/^[\w.-]+$/`).
- **Frontmatter issues** — Missing or unterminated frontmatter blocks.

`CHANGELOG*` files are always skipped.

## Development

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `npm -w @paleo/docmap run build` | Compile TypeScript (`src/` → `dist/`) |
| `npm -w @paleo/docmap test` | Run tests with Vitest |
| `npm run lint` | Biome linter (root) |

Tests live in `packages/docmap/test/docmap.test.ts` and use fixture directories under `packages/docmap/test/fixtures/` (basic, errors, empty, nested, bad-names, subdirs-only, classify, no-frontmatter, large, listable, search). Each fixture is a self-contained `docs/`-like tree passed via `--root`. The `large` fixture (≥20 `.md` files) exercises the top-level listing kept above the recursive-default threshold.

## Authoring Guide and Setup

The authoring conventions (frontmatter contract, naming, workflow) ship with the CLI as `templates/guide.md`: `docmap --guide` prints that file, rendered with the project's package-manager prefix. Project setup — bootstrapping a `docs/` tree, wiring docmap into a repo, and migrating existing docs or skills — lives in the separate `alignfirst-setup-guide` skill, distributed outside the npm package.
